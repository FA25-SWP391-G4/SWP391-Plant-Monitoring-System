# NestJS Authentication System Implementation

## Overview

This NestJS authentication system implements a complete user authentication flow including registration, login, logout, password management, and token-based authorization. The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and follows best practices for security.

## Features Implemented

### UC1: User Registration
- Email-based registration with validation
- Password strength enforcement
- Email verification via token
- Welcome email functionality

### UC2: User Login
- Email/password authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Access and refresh tokens
- Session management

### UC3: User Logout
- Token invalidation via blacklisting
- Secure session termination

### UC11: Password Management
- Forgot password functionality
- Password reset via email token
- Secure token validation

### UC12: Password Change
- Authenticated password change
- Current password verification
- Session invalidation after password change

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token blacklisting for revocation
- Token expiration and renewal
- Protection against token reuse
- Rate limiting support (to be added)

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: 
   - User submits registration data
   - System validates input and checks email uniqueness
   - Password is hashed securely
   - Verification token is generated and sent via email
   - User account is created with verified=false
   - Initial JWT tokens are returned

2. **Email Verification**:
   - User clicks link in verification email
   - System validates token and marks account as verified
   - User can now access protected resources

3. **Login**:
   - User submits email/password
   - System validates credentials
   - If valid, system generates access and refresh tokens
   - Tokens are returned to client for use in subsequent requests

4. **Authentication**:
   - Client includes access token in Authorization header
   - JWT Guard validates token signature and expiration
   - Token blacklist is checked for revocation
   - If valid, user context is added to request

5. **Logout**:
   - Token is added to blacklist
   - Client discards tokens

6. **Token Refresh**:
   - When access token expires, client uses refresh token
   - System validates refresh token and issues new tokens
   - Old refresh token is blacklisted

### Password Reset Flow

1. **Forgot Password**:
   - User requests password reset with email
   - System generates reset token and sends email
   - Reset token is stored (hashed) with expiration

2. **Reset Password**:
   - User submits new password with reset token
   - System validates token and updates password
   - All existing sessions are invalidated
   - Confirmation email is sent

## Database Schema

### User Entity
- id: Primary key
- email: Unique email address
- password: Hashed password
- fullName: User's full name
- role: User role (Regular, Admin)
- isVerified: Email verification status
- verificationToken: Token for email verification
- passwordResetToken: Token for password reset
- passwordResetExpires: Expiration time for reset token
- lastLogin: Timestamp of last login
- createdAt: Account creation timestamp
- updatedAt: Last update timestamp

### TokenBlacklist Entity
- id: Primary key
- userId: Foreign key to User
- token: Blacklisted token
- blacklistedAt: When token was blacklisted
- expiresAt: When token expires

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authorization |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| /auth/register | POST | Register new user | Public |
| /auth/login | POST | Authenticate user | Public |
| /auth/logout | POST | Invalidate token | JWT |
| /auth/verify-email | GET | Verify email address | Public |
| /auth/forgot-password | POST | Request password reset | Public |

## Next Steps

1. Add integration tests for authentication flows
2. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
3. Add multi-factor authentication support
4. Enhance logging and monitoring
5. Implement role-based access control

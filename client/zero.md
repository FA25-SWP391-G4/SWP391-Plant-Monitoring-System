Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi[note 1] (Spanish: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in history, Messi has set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career, including eight Ballon d'Ors, six European Golden Shoes, and eight times being named the world's best player by FIFA.[note 2] In 2025, he was named the All Time Men's World Best Player by the IFFHS. He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies.[note 3] Messi's records include most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672 for Barcelona), most goals in La Liga (474), most assists in international football (60), most goal contributions in the FIFA World Cup (21), and most goal contributions in the Copa América (32). A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 890 senior career goals and provided over 390 assists for club and country—the most of any player—resulting in over 1,290 goal contributions, the highest total in the sport's history.[21]

Messi made his competitive debut for Barcelona at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first of four consecutive Ballon d'Ors, and by the 2011–12 season he set the European record for most goals in a season and established himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. During the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, he led Barcelona to a historic second treble, leading to a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. He assumed Barcelona's captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. At Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he won the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. He joined MLS club Inter Miami in July 2023.

An Argentine international, Messi is the national team's all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. Several years after his senior debut in 2005, he won the gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Assuming captaincy in 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Messi was central to ending Argentina's 28-year trophy drought by winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon d'Or that year. In the following year, he led Argentina to winning the 2022 World Cup, the country's first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023. Messi was victorious at the 2024 Copa América, his third major international title.

Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings. Following his arrival and impact on football in the US, Messi was named Time's Athlete of the Year in 2023, and was bestowed with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US president Joe Biden in 2025.

Early life
Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe Province.[22] He was the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[23]

At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father. Another early influence came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[24] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday. Since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[25][26]

Youth career
Newell's Old Boys
"When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive."

– Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[27]
Messi is a lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, based in Rosario. When he was seven years old, he first started playing for Newell's. During the six years he played for them, he scored almost 500 goals, and was a member of "The Machine of '87", a nearly unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth. Messi would regularly entertain crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time, when the first team played home games.[28][29][30] His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who Messi called "the best forward I've ever seen".[31]

His future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. He began growth hormone therapy at age 11;[32] however, his father's health insurance covered only two years of the therapy, which cost at least 1,000 pesos per month. Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[33] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised.[34][35] It was speculated for a time that he failed to sign with River Plate due to his ill health; however, in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that River Plate had wanted to sign him after he scored four goals at a trial, and even offered to pay for his medical treatment, but Newell's refused to release his player card, preventing the transfer.[36]

Barcelona
As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First-team director Carles Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[34][37] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team. He was reserved by nature, and was so quiet that some of his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and younger sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[28][37][38]


Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, aged 13.
After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now he could play in all competitions, and quickly befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[39] After completing his growth hormone therapy at 14,[40] Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league, the Spanish cup, and the Copa Catalunya.[39][41] In the Copa Catalunya final, their 4–1 victory over Espanyol became referred to in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[42] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club. Although Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England with their own offers, Messi chose to remain in Barcelona.[37][43][44]

Messi continued to progress through his club's ranks at a rapid pace, debuting for four youth teams during the 2003–04 season.[45] After being named player of the tournament in four separate international pre-season competitions with the Juvenil B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juvenil A. In the Juvenil A he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[46][47] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained that Messi caught everyone's attention in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."[48]

"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life."

– Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[49]
At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[37][50] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[51] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[52] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother". This greatly eased Messi's transition into the first team.[53][54]

To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juvenil A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos.[46][55] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80 million.[46][56] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[57] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juvenil B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored goals for four of his five teams, with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[46][55]

Club career
Main article: Career of Lionel Messi § Club career
Barcelona
2004–2008: Rise to the first team

Messi began the 2004–05 season as a guaranteed starter for the Barcelona B team, but after some lobbying by the senior players, he was promoted to the first team by manager Frank Rijkaard.[52] He made his La Liga debut for Barcelona on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol,[37] and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[58][59] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition, and the club won the league title during that season.[54][60]

On his 18th birthday, he signed his first contract as a senior team player, a five-year contract through 2010 with a release clause of €150 million.[61] Three months later, as his performance continued to make waves, his contract was updated to a nine-year contract, doubling his salary and keeping him at the club until 2014.[56][62]

Barcelona began the 2005–06 season by winning the Supercopa de España without Messi, who was not selected to participate in the competition.[19] By the end of the season, the team won La Liga again as well as the UEFA Champions League, although Messi did not play in the final for the latter due to injury.[63][64]

During the 2006–07 season, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico against Real Madrid, the first player to do so in 12 years.[65] An incredibly finesse goal from Messi against Getafe and another goal scored by a handball against Espanyol gained notice for their similarities to the two famous goals scored by fellow Argentine Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup match against England, drawing comparisons between the two that Messi would face throughout his career.[66][67][68] The team finished the season with only one trophy – the 2006 Supercopa de España.

Barcelona finished the next 2007–08 season trophyless, leading to Rijkaard's departure.[69]

2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola
At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, his first under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[70] Over time, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's possession-based system, increasing his goalscoring rate as a result.[71] During that season, Messi scored 38 total goals, and alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[72][73] Messi played as a false nine for the first time in a Clásico against Real Madrid, setting up his side's first goal and scoring twice in the team's greatest-ever score at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[74][75] He played his first final, winning the Copa del Rey.[76] In addition, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, thus achieving the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[77]


Messi during the 2009 Joan Gamper Trophy against Manchester City
During the first half of the 2009–10 season, Barcelona would also win the Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, resulting in becoming the first club to achieve the sextuple.[78][79] Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history.[80] For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[81] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equalling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[82][83] He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League,[84] and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[83][85] After the team won the Champions League, he signed a new 7-year contract through 2016.[61]

In the 2010–11 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de España,[86] Champions League,[87] and a third consecutive La Liga title. His club performances in 2010 earned him his second consecutive Ballon d'Or.[88] Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year,[89] and the league's top scorer and assist provider.[90][91] He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.[90][92]

"I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's impossible, this kid is unique."

– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer at the age of 24 in March 2012[93]
Messi began the 2011–12 season winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies.[94][95] At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time.[96] For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times,[97] and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award.[98] During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns.[99][100] Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[101] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football excluding regional and local competitions.[102][103] The team would also win the Copa del Rey that season, their 14th trophy under Guardiola, who resigned following the season after a four-year cycle of success.[104]

2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia

Messi scored a record-breaking 91 goals with Argentina (above) and Barcelona (below) in 2012.
For the start of the 2012–13 season, Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013.[105] A double scored against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year; Messi would score a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina throughout 2012.[106][107] Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the first player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[107][108] He signed a new contract committing himself to the club through 2018, and wore the captain's armband for the first time in a league match against Rayo Vallecano.[109][110][111] The team would win La Liga again that year, Messi's sixth, equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[112]

Messi's overall input into the team's attack had increased significantly. Whereas he contributed to 24% of the team's goals in their treble-winning campaign in 2008–09, this number rose to more than 40% by the end of the 2012–13 season.[113] These statistics, as well as lopsided losses in the Champions League where Messi was unfit, gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[114]

To offset the load on Messi, Barcelona would sign Brazilian forward Neymar from Santos before the 2013–14 season.[115] The team would win the Supercopa de España at the beginning of the season.[116] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[117] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy.[118]

2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN

Barcelona hired coach Luis Enrique before the 2014–15 season, and would continue to aid Messi in the attack by signing Uruguayan forward Luis Suárez, who had won the European Golden Shoe the year before at Liverpool.[119][120] Luis Enrique's system would feature quick transitions from defence to attack, led by the front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar. The attacking trio, which colloquially became known as 'MSN', would break goalscoring records.[121] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla earlier in the season would also make him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[122] After securing the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League that year, Messi helped Barcelona become the first club to win the continental treble twice.[123][124] He would record 58 goals, but combined with Neymar and Suárez, the attacking trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[125]

Messi opened the 2015–16 season by helping Barcelona's win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[126] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final over River Plate in Yokohama, collecting his fifth club trophy of the calendar year.[127] On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[128] He would end the season by winning La Liga as well as the Copa del Rey again.[129] In total, Messi scored 41 goals, and Barcelona's attacking trio of him, Neymar and Suárez managed a Spanish record of 131 combined goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[130]

The 2016–17 season would end with Messi winning the Supercopa de España and the Copa del Rey.[131][132] He would finish the season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[133] Messi, Neymar and Suárez would combine for 110 goals by season's end. Neymar would depart for Paris Saint Germain the next year, leaving the attacking trio with a combined total of 363 goals over the course of three seasons.[134] Luis Enrique would also leave Barcelona at the end of the season after managing the club to a total of nine trophies during his three-year tenure.[135]

2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona

Messi would sign a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November 2017, his ninth contract with the club, keeping him with the club through 2021.[136] The 2017–18 season saw Messi achieving the domestic double, winning La Liga and the Copa del Rey once again.[137] He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth European Golden Shoe award.[138] With the departure of former captain Andrés Iniesta in May 2018, Messi was named the team's new captain for the 2018–19 season.[139] He lifted his first trophy as Barcelona's captain, the Supercopa de España, following a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. He helped Barcelona clinch the La Liga title, his tenth but first as captain.[140] With 36 goals in 34 appearances that season, he won his sixth league Golden Boot trophy, equalling Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga.[141][142] He also captured his sixth Golden Shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016–17 season.[143]

Messi would win his sixth Ballon d'Or, but the subsequent 2019–20 season saw Barcelona go trophyless for the first time since 2007–08.[144] Following a disappointing season, Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club "a document expressing his desire to leave", but Messi ultimately decided to fulfill the final year of his contract.[145][146] The 2020–21 season saw Messi surpass Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances.[147] He would lead the club to victory in the 2021 Copa del Rey final.[148][149] His last two seasons with Barcelona saw him lead La Liga in goal scoring, giving him a record-breaking total of eight Pichichi trophies.[150][151]

Messi became a free agent after his contract expired, with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to Barcelona's financial issues.[152][153] Barcelona would eventually announce that Messi would not be staying at the club, citing financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[154][155] In a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[156]

Paris Saint-Germain

On 10 August 2021, Messi joined Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), reuniting him with Neymar, for the 2021–22 season on a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[157][158] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[159] He would make his debut with the club against Reims, made his first start and Champions League debut for the club against Club Brugge, and made his home debut in a match against Lyon[160][161][162] He scored his first goal for the club in a Champions League group stage win over former manager Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.[163] Having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year in addition to captaining Argentina to the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or.[164] He finished his debut season with PSG with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions, helping the club win their 10th Ligue 1 title.[165]

Beginning the 2022–23 season, Messi would win his second trophy with PSG in the Trophée des Champions.[166] A goal against Nice resulted in him surpassing Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time highest goalscorer in European club football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal contributions at club level.[167][168] By the end of the season, he had 21 goals across all competitors and the highest number of assists in the league with 16, which helped PSG clinch their 11th Ligue 1 title and his second in a row.[169][170][171] Following the last game of the season, manager Christophe Galtier confirmed that it would be Messi's last for PSG, with the club confirming his departure two days later.[172]

Inter Miami

Messi with Inter Miami in the 2023 U.S. Open Cup
Major League Soccer (MLS) club Inter Miami CF announced the signing of Messi on a two-and-a-half-year contract on 15 July 2023.[173][174] Messi's arrival in the US was praised as a revelation, on and off the pitch, and his presence was credited for helping to raise the profile of MLS within the US and abroad. According to Goal, "Every game that he graces sparks a scramble for tickets, with plenty of A-list guests eager to watch him in action".[175] The frenzy over his arrival was dubbed "Messimania", and Inter Miami's No. 10 Messi jersey became the best-selling jersey in the league, and nearly the world.[176]

Messi made his 2023 debut for the club in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a victory.[177] DeAndre Yedlin, the previous captain of Inter Miami, gave his armband to Messi, who took over as team captain.[178] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi led the team to the club's first-ever trophy, as it won the Leagues Cup final against Nashville SC.[179] Messi made his MLS debut against the New York Red Bulls.[180] Miami would miss the playoffs, finishing 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[181] On 30 October 2023, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[182] He was also named Time Athlete of the Year, the first footballer ever to win the award.[183]

During the 2024 season, Messi broke the record for the most assists in a single MLS game with five assists, and broke the record for the most goal contributions in an MLS game with six, in a 6–2 win over the New York Red Bulls.[184] On 2 October, Messi scored a brace in a 3–2 win over the Columbus Crew, clinching the Supporters' Shield, his 46th trophy.[185] In the final game of the regular season on 19 October against the New England Revolution, Messi scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 6–2 victory. Inter Miami's victory over the Revolution also allowed the club to finish with 74 points throughout the regular season, a league record for MLS. He would finish the regular season with 20 goals and 16 assists in 19 matches.[186] In doing so, he became Inter Miami's all-time top goalscorer.[187] Miami made its first postseason appearance in the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs but were eliminated in the first round after losing two games against Atlanta United. Messi would have his first postseason goal in the third game, a 3–2 loss.[188] He would be named the MLS Most Valuable Player following the conclusion of the regular season.[189]

During the 2025 season, Messi became the fastest player to reach 40 goals in league history.[190] He was featured in a Super Bowl ad by Apple TV for their exclusive MLS coverage. He ended the season winning the MLS Golden Boot as the league's top scorer, with 29 goals and 19 assists in 28 games.[191] On 23 October, Messi signed a three-year contract extension which would see him at the club through 2028, by which time he would be 41-years-old.[192]

International career
Main article: Career of Lionel Messi § International career
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[193] He debuted for Argentina in 2004 for Argentina's U20 team against Paraguay, and was subsequently included in the squad for the 2005 South American U-20 Championship, where they would finish third.[194] Messi would then lead the team to victory in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, his first success with Argentina. Finishing the tournament with six goals and two assists, he would also win the Golden Ball.[195][196][197]

Messi would make his debut with the senior national team in 2005, at age 18, coming off the bench in a friendly against Hungary.[198] Messi would have his first start in 2006 against Peru, and would score his first international goal in a friendly against Croatia.[199][200] His World Cup debut came in the 2006 FIFA World Cup as a substitute in the 74th minute against Serbia and Montenegro, assisting one goal and scoring the final one in their victory. This made him the youngest player to represent and score for Argentina in the World Cup.[201] He would represent Argentina again for the 2007 Copa América, where they would ultimately lose in the final. Messi was named the best young player of the tournament, having scored two goals and provided one assist.[202] The 2008 Summer Olympics would mark another major achievement with his country, as he led Argentina's U23 team to claim the Olympic gold medal over Nigeria. Messi registered two goals and three assists throughout, and was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[203]

With the international retirement of Juan Román Riquelme, Messi was given Argentina's number 10 shirt.[204] During a 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Greece, where a majority of the starters rested due to a secured place in the knockout rounds, Messi would wear the captain's armband for the first time.[205] Argentina were ultimately eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, but Messi was identified as one of the tournament's 10 best players due to his pace and creativity, despite failing to register a single goal and only having one assist.[206] Ahead of the 2011 Copa América, Argentina began building their team around Messi.[207] However, Messi would again be goalless during the tournament but had three assists. The team would ultimately lose to Uruguay on penalties during the quarter-final.[208]


Messi against Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final
Following their unsuccessful performance, a 24-year-old Messi would be awarded the captaincy of the squad.[209] The next several years saw many frustrations for Messi due to his inability to lead Argentina to win an international trophy. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Messi and Argentina lost to Germany in the final, though Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament regardless due to his overall performance with four goals and an assist.[210][211] Argentina would lose to Chile on penalties in the 2015 Copa América final the next year. At the close of the tournament, Messi was reportedly selected to receive the Golden Ball award, having scored one goal and provided three assists, but he rejected the honour.[212] In the 2016 Copa América Centenario semi-final against the United States, a goal from Messi would put him ahead of Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer in international matches.[213] However, Argentina would again fall to Chile on penalties in the final.[214] Messi would have five goals and four assists throughout the tournament.[215]

Losing three consecutive finals in three consecutive years caused Messi to retire from international football, but a nationwide campaign in Argentina helped convince him to reverse his decision.[214][216] He would return to the national team to lead them to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Argentina were in jeopardy of missing the tournament on the last game of the qualifiers against Ecuador, but a hat-trick from Messi dramatically secured their entry.[217] They would go on to lose to France in the round of 16 during the World Cup, with Messi having one goal and two assists in the tournament.[218] The next year, Messi would again represent Argentina in the 2019 Copa América, where he registered only a single goal and assist. They would lose to hosts Brazil in the semi-final but ended with a third-place finish after defeating Chile.[219] Despite not winning the tournament, this victory would mark the beginning of a 36-game unbeaten streak for Argentina that would last for more than three years.[220]

Messi would finally end Argentina's 28-year trophy drought in the 2021 Copa América, as they had not won an international tournament since 1993.[221] During a group stage match against Bolivia, he surpassed Javier Mascherano to become Argentina's most-capped player.[222] Argentina defeated Brazil in the final, and Messi was named the player of the tournament having been directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four of them and assisting five.[221] He captained Argentina to win another international trophy in the 2022 Finalissima against UEFA Euro 2020 winners Italy, where he was named player of the match after providing two assists.[223] At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Messi led Argentina to its first World Cup victory in 36 years, scoring twice in the final to defeat France.[224] Having scored seven goals and assisted three during the tournament, Messi would again win the Golden Ball, becoming the first player to win it twice.[225] His appearance in the final also set new records for the most appearances (26) and direct goal contributions (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists) at the World Cup.[226]

A hat-trick in a 2023 friendly against Curaçao saw Messi reach 100 international goals, the third player and the first South American in history to achieve this milestone, and a brace against Peru later that year resulted in Messi becoming the all-time top goalscorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers.[227][228] During the 2024 Copa América semi-final against Canada, Messi scored his first and only goal of the tournament which also made him the second-highest international goalscorer of all time.[229] Argentina eventually won the final against Colombia for their second consecutive Copa América title, with Messi contributing one goal and one assist overall while also setting a new record for most appearances (39) at Copa América.[230] His start against Venezuela in 2025 saw him tie the record set by Iván Hurtado for most appearances in CONMEBOL World Cup qualification matches (72), and the two assists he provided in a friendly against Puerto Rico later that year resulted in him reaching 60 in total, making him the top assist-provider in men’s international football history.[231][232]

Player profile
Style of play

Messi prepares to shoot with his dominant left foot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[233][234] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").[235][236][237] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[28][234][238] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[239] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."[240] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[241][242]

A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[243] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[244][245][246] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[234][247] As of July 2025, Messi ranks third all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 69,[248] the most among active players.[249] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[250]


Messi's dribbling abilities allow him to weave past several defenders and orchestrate attacking plays.
Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[238][247][251] He is widely considered to be one of the greatest dribblers of all time.[252][253] With regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control."[242] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[233][234]

As his career advanced, and his athleticism and tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[254][255][256] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[257]

Tactical positioning

A versatile forward, Messi often plays as a classic number 10.
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[258] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[240] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[38]

Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[259][260] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[261][262] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[263] or even on the right wing[264] or as a false nine,[265][266] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[262] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Luis Suárez.[267][268] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline. Under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[269][270]

Reception
Messi is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo.[271] He is also considered one of the greatest footballers in the history of the sport.[272] In 2025, he was named the All Time Men's World Best Player by the IFFHS.[273]

A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[274] Shortly after teammate Ronaldinho won the 2005 Ballon d'Or, he commented, "I'm not even the best at Barça" in reference to his 18-year-old protégé.[275] Four years later, after Messi won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[81] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[24][238][276] An early proponent was his then-Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[277] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players.[92][278] By the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[279][280]

Messi would receive dismissals by critics throughout his career based on the fact that he had not won an international tournament at senior level with Argentina.[281][282][283] However, his subsequent victories in the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup resulted in him finally winning every top tier trophy at both the club and country levels, an achievement that many pundits felt cemented Messi's legacy.[272]

Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo
Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry

Messi has been compared with Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers.
Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Cristiano Ronaldo, who many consider his career rival.[271] Both achieved numerous individual accolades, won dozens of trophies for both club and country, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[284][285] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[286] Pundits have compared the ongoing rivalry to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Prost–Senna rivalry in motorsport, and the tennis rivalries between Federer–Nadal and Borg–McEnroe.[287]

Fans and pundits alike regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[286][288] Messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling, playmaking, passing and goalscoring, while Ronaldo has received praise for his exceptional speed and athleticism, goalscoring skills, and performance under pressure.[289][290] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build, compared to Messi's smaller size – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[291] Regarding individual achievements, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[292] eight FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[293] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[294]

Messi's head-to-head record against teams that feature Ronaldo consists of 15 wins, 9 draws, and 10 losses in competitive club matches, one win and loss each in international friendlies, and one win in a club friendly. The first competitive matchup between the two occurred in 2008, when Ronaldo's Manchester United were drawn to play Messi's Barcelona in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, where Ronaldo and Manchester United would eventually advance 1–0 on aggregate, and go on to win the final.[295] The two players and their teams would meet again in the next year's Champions League, this time in the final, with Messi and Barcelona emerging as the victors after a 2–0 result.[296] After this, Ronaldo would transfer to Real Madrid, the main rivals of Barcelona, and from 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[297][294] Ronaldo's would then transfer to Juventus in the summer of 2018; their final matchup in a competitive match would occur during a 2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage match, where Ronaldo's two goals from the penalty spot helped Juventus to a 3–0 victory against Messi's Barcelona.[298] After Ronaldo left Real Madrid for Juventus, Messi stated: "I miss Cristiano. Although it was a bit difficult to see him win trophies, he gave La Liga prestige."[299]

Following Messi leading Argentina to victory in the 2022 World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi settled the debate between the two players.[300][301] Ronaldo himself declared a year later that his rivalry with Messi was over and "gone", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".[302]

Comparisons with Diego Maradona
Main article: New Maradona
"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi."

– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[303]
Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who was also considered the best player of his generation and one of greatest in the history of the sport.[304][305] This was due to their short statures, their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed playmakers, and the fact that they both came from Argentina.[306] Initially, Messi was merely one of many young Argentine players to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the best player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[35][307] Even when Messi was 18 years old, Maradona called him the best player in the world and hailed him as his successor.[303] Messi and Maradona would work together as player and manager for Argentina's national side from 2008 through the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the latter thoroughly impressed with the former's skills.[308] It was during this period that Messi was given Argentina's number 10 shirt that Maradona famously wore. Maradona gave Messi his blessing, telling him: "the No 10 is yours. There's nobody better than you to wear it."[204]


Due to their similar size and style of play, Messi was constantly compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona by pundits and his countrymen.
During the early and middle parts of his career, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona in Argentine society. Part of this had to do with Messi's lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period – Maradona had famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a dominant overall performance, which set expectations for Messi to do the same.[281][304][309] Also unlike Maradona, Messi never played in the Argentine Primera División, therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself, and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in La Liga instead.[28][309] Argentines also identified more with the fiery, extroverted and controversial Maradona who came from the slums, character traits that they felt aligned with their national values, as opposed to the reserved, introverted and unassuming Messi who had a comparably unremarkable upbringing in Rosario.[283][309][310] Several pundits, footballing figures, and Maradona himself would point to this temperament to question Messi's leadership capabilities for the national team.[281][311][312] Furthermore, Messi's lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt, early tendency not to sing the national anthem, and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[208][313] However, despite having lived in Barcelona since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally, saying: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy."[314]

Football journalist Tim Vickery stated the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become "more one of the group, more Argentine".[313] Other pundits noted that Messi had grown more assertive as a leader during the 2019 Copa América by becoming more vocal with his teammates both on and off the pitch, finally singing the national anthem with the team before matches, and speaking with journalists at length after matches, the latter of which he rarely did for Barcelona.[315] Following the 2022 World Cup win for Messi and Argentina, Vickery felt that Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[313] Former footballer turned journalist Jorge Valdano said he saw a "Maradonian" edge to Messi's performances during the tournament, while compatriot Osvaldo Ardiles mentioned that Messi's provoking actions against the Netherlands side during the quarter-final were "more of a Maradona reaction," further endearing Messi to his countrymen.[316][317] Messi himself later remarked that the World Cup victory "won over all the people of Argentina. Today 95% or 100% of Argentines love me and that's a beautiful feeling."[318]

In popular culture
Popularity

Messi's success on the pitch earned him several lucrative endorsement deals along with widespread recognition and popularity.
Messi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023.[319][320][321] According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, and the most likeable of all contemporary players.[322][323] World Press Photo selected "The Final Game", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[324] On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a "tourist attraction".[325]

His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had more than 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Ronaldo.[326][327] He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Ronaldo.[328] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with more than 75 million likes.[329]

On 20 March 2023, during a return to Buenos Aires following his World Cup victory, Messi was mobbed by hundreds of adoring fans when he and his family were out to dinner. When news spread where Messi and his family were, the restaurant was soon surrounded by locals hoping to get a glimpse of their World Cup-winning captain. Police assistance would be needed to get Messi back to his car in the early hours of the morning.[330] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[331] During the festival, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[332] In December 2023, a set of shirts Messi had worn during the 2022 World Cup was sold at auction for $7.8 million.[333]

During an exhibition match on 4 February 2024 in which Inter Miami faced off against the Hong Kong League players at Hong Kong Stadium, Messi remained on the bench the entire game, causing massive backlash in Hong Kong and China as a result.[334] A Messi commercial was taken off air in those regions,[335] while others remained despite pressure from Chinese social-media users.[336][337][338] Furthermore, the Chinese Football Association temporarily halted its partnership with the Argentine Football Association over the incident on 8 February.[339]

Wealth and sponsorships
Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[340][341] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Cristiano Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[342] In 2018, he was the first player to exceed the €100 million benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126 million ($154 million) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[343] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[344] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[345][346][109] Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus.[347] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[347] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[348] When signing with Inter Miami, his base salary was set at $12 million with guaranteed compensation totalling $20.4 million for the 2023 season; Messi was also set to earn additional shares from shirt sales, MLS Season Pass subscriptions, and a stake in the club itself.[349]


Messi's Argentina jersey, supplied by Adidas, was sold out worldwide during the 2022 World Cup.[350]
In addition to salary and bonuses, much of Messi's income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[351] His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[352] Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[294] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[353][354] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[355] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[356] At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out Messi's No. 10 Argentina jersey worldwide.[350]


After blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[357] His goal celebration features in the FIFA video game series.
As a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[358][359] From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[358][360] Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[361][362][363][364] In order to celebrate his achievement of becoming Barcelona's all-time goalscorer, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against.[365] Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[366][367]

In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[368][369] In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, "sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends."[370]

In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was widely criticised for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[371][372]

Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[373][374] Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[375] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[376]


Messi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2010.
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[377] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[378] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[378][379] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global "Messi and Friends" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[380][381] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[382]

Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[378] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[28] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[383] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[384] This was split between Clinic Barcelona in Barcelona and his native Argentina.[385] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he would be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[386]

In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[387][388] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[389]

In advance of the 2021 Copa América, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech – whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi – in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[390] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that "Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones".[390]

In January 2025, Messi was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States, by President Joe Biden for his contributions in supporting healthcare and education programs for children around the world.[391] He would be unable to attend the ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, but sent a letter expressing his appreciation for the honour and his hopes of meeting President Biden at a later date.[392]

Public art

One of many street art displays depicting Messi
Street art and public murals depicting Messi are regularly painted around the world.[393][394] One prominent artwork that went viral is the Sistine Chapel of Football, a parody of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam that features both Messi and Diego Maradona, along with several other prominent Argentine footballers. The work is exhibited at the Sportivo Pereyra club from Barracas in Buenos Aires.[395]

Several public sculptures with Messi's likeness have been erected. Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[396] After the announcement of his first retirement from the international team in June 2016, a bronze statue of Messi was erected in Buenos Aires days later in an attempt to convince him to return.[397] A life-sized statue of Messi holding the World Cup trophy was unveiled outside the CONMEBOL headquarters in Luque, Paraguay in March 2023, a few months after Argentina's World Cup win. The statue would stand alongside those of Pelé and Maradona.[398]

Media
Messi, a documentary by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival in August 2014.[399] Messi's World Cup: The Rise of a Legend, a biographical docuseries focusing on Messi's career, his highs and lows with the Argentina national football team, and their eventual success at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, aired on Apple TV+ on 21 February 2024.[400]

Business ventures
On 4 June 2024, Messi announced the release of Más+, an American brand of sports and energy drinks.[401] Messi created the drink because he couldn't find a flavourful and healthy hydration option that suited his needs.[402] The drink was teased to debut in Miami, Florida, on 13 June 2024. It was released in Publix and Walmart stores and made available for delivery on Gopuff in South Florida the following day.[401] Más+ is affiliated with White Claw Hard Seltzer founder Mark Anthony.[403]

Later that year, on 19 September 2024, Messi announced that he would be launching a production company called 525 Rosario, named after his hometown. Headquartered in Miami and Los Angeles, the company was created to produce film, sporting events and branded commercials for athletes worldwide. It would be a joint venture with Smuggler Entertainment, who co-produced Messi's World Cup: The Rise of a Legend earlier in 2024.[404]

In March 2025, Messi was invited by his Uruguayan colleague and friend Luis Suárez to take part in a new soccer project, Deportivo LSM.[405] The new team will focus on football training.[406]

Personal life
Family and relationships
Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, who he eventually married on 30 June 2017 in their hometown of Rosario.[407][408] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who was also a football player.[409] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[410]

Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[411] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[412] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[413] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[414] Messi and his family are Catholic.[415]

Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[416]

Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of "The Machine of '87" at Newell's Old Boys. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[28][378][417] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[418] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[419]

Tax fraud
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[420] Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things."[421]

Notes
 According to FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, Messi by Guillem Balagué, his surname is the single "Messi", in accordance with Argentine customs.[2][3] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double "Messi Cuccittini".[4] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: "The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders."[5]
 Messi received France Football's 2009 Ballon d'Or and FIFA's 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year award, prior to their six-year merger; he proceeded to win the newly formed award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, four times: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015. Both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballon d'Or awards.[6][7][8] He then went on to win the Ballon d'Or three more times – 2019, 2021, 2023 – again solely assigned by France Football, and won the newly established The Best FIFA Men's Player three times as well – 2019, 2022, 2023. France Football recognises him as a record eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA recognises him as a record eight-time world's best player.[9][10]
 According to FC Barcelona,[11] FIFA,[12] Major League Soccer,[13] the Royal Spanish Football Federation,[14] and multiple media outlets,[15][16][17] Messi also won the 2005 Supercopa de España, bringing his Barcelona trophy total to 35 and his career total to 46.[18] However, this particular trophy is not credited here since Messi was out of the squad and did not feature in any of the two games against Real Betis.[19][20]
 Does not include an unofficial friendly match played on 24 May 2008 in Barcelona between Argentina U23 and the Catalonia national football team,[446][447] as Catalonia is not affiliated with either FIFA or UEFA as a national member association and is therefore not allowed to participate in official competitions.[448]

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu] ⓘ; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for, and captains, both Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr and the Portugal national team. Nicknamed CR7, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in history, and has won numerous individual accolades throughout his career, including five Ballon d'Ors, a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, four European Golden Shoes, and was named five times the world's best player by FIFA.[note 3] He has won 34 trophies in his career, including five UEFA Champions Leagues and the UEFA European Championship. He holds the records for most goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals (14) and assists (8) in the European Championship, and most international appearances (225) and international goals (143). He is the only player to have scored 100 goals with four different clubs. He has made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 950 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.

Born in Funchal, Madeira, Ronaldo began his career with Sporting CP before signing with Manchester United in 2003. He became a star player at United, where he won three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup. His 2007–08 season earned him his first Ballon d'Or at age 23. In 2009, Ronaldo became the subject of the then-most expensive transfer in history when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €94 million (£80 million). At Madrid, he was at the forefront of the club's resurgence as a dominant European force, helping them win four Champions Leagues between 2014 and 2018, including the long-awaited La Décima. He also won two La Liga titles, including the record-breaking 2011–12 season in which Madrid reached 100 points, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He won Ballon d'Ors in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times to Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. Following issues with the club hierarchy, Ronaldo signed for Juventus in 2018 in a transfer worth an initial €100 million, where he was pivotal in winning two Serie A titles. In 2021, he returned to United before joining Al-Nassr in 2023.

Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player.[7] He has played in eleven major tournaments. He scored his first international goal in Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final and subsequently made the team of the tournament. He assumed captaincy of the national team ahead of Euro 2008; and at Euro 2012, he was named in the team of the tournament. Ronaldo led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, being named in the team of the tournament for the third time. In the 2018 World Cup, he had his most prolific World Cup campaign with four goals. He received the Golden Boot as the top scorer of Euro 2020 before playing in his fifth World Cup at the 2022 World Cup. He has won two UEFA Nations Leagues, in 2019 and 2025. Ahead of the 2026 World Cup, he became the all-time top scorer in World Cup qualification, with 41 goals.

One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes on five occasions, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the most popular sportsperson on social media: he counts over 1 billion total followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, making him the first person to achieve that feat. Ronaldo was named in the UEFA Ultimate Team of the Year in 2015, the All-time UEFA Euro XI in 2016, and the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020. In recognition of his record-breaking goalscoring success, he received special awards for Outstanding Career Achievement by FIFA in 2021 and Champions League All-Time Top Scorer by UEFA in 2024.

Early life
Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[8][9] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[10][11] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha.[12][13][14] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[15][16] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Kátia".[2] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[17] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[18][19] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[20]

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[21] where his father was the kit man,[12] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[22] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[22] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[23] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[24][25]

With a troubled life as a student,[26] and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family,[27][28] he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[29][30] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[24] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[31] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[32] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[33] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional football player.[34]

Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo, and has described them as leaving "a beautiful history in football".[35]

Club career
Main article: Career of Cristiano Ronaldo § Club career
Sporting CP
After impressing in Sporting's youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan,[36] and his Primeira Liga debut, took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[37] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[38] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[39]

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[40] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[40][41]

Manchester United
2003–2007: Development and breakthrough
"There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."

—Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[42]
On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million,[43] an England record for a teenager.[44] This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[45]

Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[46] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[47] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[48]


Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against Chelsea during the 2005–06 Premier League season
Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003.[49] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[42] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[50] On 15 May 2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the first red card of his career.[51][52] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football with a trophy, scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final.[53] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[54] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[55] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[56]

"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."

—Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season.[54]
At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[57][58] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[59]

During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[60] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[61] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[62] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[63] Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[64] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title.[65]

2007–2009: Collective and individual success and Ballon d'Or

Ronaldo (pictured during 2007-08) evolved into the best player in the world in this season, according to many pundits and fellow players.[66]
In the 2006–07 season, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season, winning the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, Young Player of the Year awards, and the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[67][68] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[69] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[70] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[71]

Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008.[72] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[73] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[74] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[75][76] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[77] United emerged victorious, winning 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at the end of 120 minutes.[78][79] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[80] With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968,[81] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[82]

Shortly after, Ronaldo was linked to a move to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[83] and he remained at United for another year.[84] His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[85] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[86] United advanced to the final in Rome,[87] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[88]

Real Madrid
2009–2015: World record transfer and consecutive Ballon d'Or wins

Ronaldo adapted tremendously to Spanish football, scoring 33 goals in just 35 games in his debut season.
In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million.[89] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[90] Ronaldo said, "This is the completion of my boyhood dream, to be a Real Madrid player."[91]

Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[92] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[93] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[94] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[95][96] Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid's 96 points in La Liga, his first season with Madrid ended trophyless.[97]


Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain.
Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given No. 7 for the 2010–11 season and scored 53 goals, helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey, scoring the winning goal against rivals Barcelona in the El Clásico, his first trophy with Madrid.[98] He also became the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[99] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[100]

The following season saw Ronaldo score 60 goals across all competitions,[101] leading Madrid to their first league title in four years with a record 100 points and his runner-up finish to Lionel Messi in the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[102] He scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[103] In the 2012–13 season, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[104] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[105] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[106]

Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[107] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clásico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[108]


Ronaldo scored a record 17 UEFA Champions League goals during the 2013–14 season en route to La Décima.
In 2013–14 season, Ronaldo was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale and together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed "BBC", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).[109] He continued prolific scoring, with 69 goals in 2013, winning the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or,[110] and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[111]

Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup, scoring a penalty in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over city rivals Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[112] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[113] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[114] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, along with Liverpool's Luis Suárez.[115] On 4 May, Ronaldo scored a back-heeled volley in the closing moments of the match against Valencia, voted goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (LFP),[116] giving him the Best Player in La Liga award.[117]

During the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, and after winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[118] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[119] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[120] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[121] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[122] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[123] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[124] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[125]

2015–2018: All-time Madrid top scorer and fifth Ballon d'Or
Cristiano Ronaldo became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer on 12 September 2015 against Espanyol, netting 230 goals in 203 matches, surpassing the previous record holder, Raúl.[126] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[127] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[128] He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.[129]


Ronaldo in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final, his final game for Real Madrid
In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[130] On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.[131] He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012.[132]

In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career.[133] Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.[134]

On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[135] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[136] On 3 April 2018, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a "PlayStation goal" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[137]

In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[138] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[139] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[140]

Juventus
Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club.[141] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[142] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[143]

2018–2020: Consecutive Serie A titles

On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona.[144] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juve, he was sent off against Valencia, his first red card in 154 Champions League appearances.[145] In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia, Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first ever player to do so.[146]

Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[147] On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.[148] On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.[149] On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.[150] With 21 goals and eight assists, Ronaldo won the league award for Most Valuable Player.[151]

On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen including breaking Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time.[152] On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria.[153] He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari and became only the second player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A.[154] On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2–1 away win against SPAL.[155] On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history.[156] On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin Džeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues.[157] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[158] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[159] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[160]

2020–2021: 100 Juve goals, Capocannoniere, and departure
Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79.[161] On 2 March 2021, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe.[162] On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[163] With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[164] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[165]

The start of the following season came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[166] despite Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reaching a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[167] but the club pulled out of the deal,[168] and later it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[169][170] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[171][172]

Return to Manchester United

On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[173][174] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[175] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[176]

On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[177] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[178] Ronaldo proved to be crucial in the next Champions League fixtures, scoring various last minute goals to help United qualify for the round of 16 as group winners.[179] On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.[180] Struggles ensued, with a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager, continuing for two months,[181] until he scored in United's 2–0 win at home versus Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022, his first in the new year.[182] He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award,[183][184] but United finished in a disappointing sixth place and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; as a result, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.[185]

After growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo desired to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, but a move failed to materialise, with various European clubs refusing a transfer, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands.[186][187] Shortly after, he fell out with manager Erik ten Hag who used him as a substitute, leading United to terminate his contract on 22 November, following an interview with Piers Morgan, where Ronaldo said that he felt "betrayed" by Ten Hag and criticised the management of the club.[188]

Al-Nassr

Ronaldo with Al-Nassr in September 2023
On 30 December 2022, Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club, signing a contract until 2025.[189] Ronaldo received the highest football salary ever, at €200 million per year,[190][191] including a guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals bringing his total annual salary to €200 million.

He made his debut for Al-Nassr on 22 January 2023, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win over Al-Ettifaq,[192] and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty.[193] On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al-Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal.[194] According to the BBC, Ronaldo's transfer to Al-Nassr led a "revolution" in Asian football, with many players from other leagues, particularly those in Europe, transferring to Saudi Pro League clubs for the 2023–24 season.[195][196][197]

In the final of the Arab Club Champions Cup on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2–1 after extra time. Ronaldo scored six goals in the competition.[198] At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023, reaching the same goalscoring record as in 2016.[199][200] On 27 May 2024, in Al-Nassr's home fixture against Al-Ittihad, Ronaldo scored his 34th and 35th league goals of the campaign, surpassing Abderrazak Hamdallah's record for the most goals scored in a single Saudi Pro League season. He also became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in four different leagues, the English, Spanish, Italian and Saudi leagues.[201] On 31 May, in a 5–4 penalty shoot-out defeat to Al-Hilal in the 2024 King Cup final following a 1–1 draw after extra-time (in which he scored his side's second spot kick), he equalled Rogério Ceni's record for most top-level matches by a male professional footballer (1,225).[202]

Ronaldo finished the 2024–25 season with 25 league goals, becoming the league's top scorer for a second consecutive time.[203]

International career
Main article: Career of Cristiano Ronaldo § International career

At the age of 18, Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal as a substitute against Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003.[204] At UEFA Euro 2004, he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance.[205][206] Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final, Ronaldo made the team of the tournament, with two assists and two goals.[207] In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[208] Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France, with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident that occurred in the quarter-finals against England.[209] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[210][211]


Ronaldo, pictured playing against Germany at Euro 2012, was made captain for Portugal in 2008.
On 6 February 2007, Cristiano captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly against Brazil.[212] He wore the number 7 shirt ahead of UEFA Euro 2008.[213] Despite scoring eight goals in qualifications,[214] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the finals, netting the second goal of Portugal's 3–1 win in the group stage game against the Czech Republic. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 3–2 loss to Germany.[215]

Ronaldo failed to score in 2010 World Cup qualifying.[210] He scored only one goal in the 2010 World Cup finals; despite this, he was named man of the match in all three group stage matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[216][217][218] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 demolishing of North Korea, which was his first international goal in 16 months.[219] Two years later, in UEFA Euro 2012, Ronaldo was joint top scorer with three goals, enough for him to be included in the team of the tournament.[6] During qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored eight goals. Despite this, Portugal did not qualify directly; Ronaldo scored all four goals against Sweden in the play-off to qualify.[220] At the tournament in Brazil, Ronaldo assisted a last-minute 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[221] and scored an 80th-minute winner in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[222]


Ronaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's Euro 2016 quarter-final match against Poland.
In 2016, Ronaldo led Portugal to their first-ever trophy at the UEFA Euro 2016, although he was subbed off in the 25th minute in the final against hosts France.[223] He received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer, which gave him his fourth Ballon d'Or later that year. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place, with Ronaldo being named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[224][225]

In the 2018 World Cup, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, in a 3–3 draw against Spain.[226] The following match, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals.[227] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[228]

Ronaldo led Portugal to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals,[229] and received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. Ronaldo also became the first player to score at five European Championships.[230] On 23 June 2021, Ronaldo scored two goals in the Euro 2020 match against France, breaking the men's goalscoring record previously held by Ali Daei.[231]


Ronaldo during a group stage game against Uruguay at the 2022 World Cup
On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player.[232][233] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, thus becoming the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.[234]

In the 2022 World Cup, on 24 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score at five World Cups, netting a penalty against Ghana.[235] Following a dispute with manager Fernando Santos, after their last group game against South Korea, he was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[236] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[237]


Ronaldo during an interview at the UEFA Euro 2024
On 23 March 2023, Ronaldo scored a brace against Liechtenstein as he earned his 197th overall cap to become the most capped male footballer of all time.[238] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[239] On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their qualifying group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice.[240] The landmark goals meant he had scored more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).[241][242]

With his start in Portugal's UEFA Euro 2024 opener against the Czech Republic, Ronaldo became the first player to feature in six European Championships, having previously been the first player to appear in five.[243] Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League.[244] On 8 June 2025, Ronaldo won his second UEFA Nations League title, helping Portugal defeat Spain in the final, scoring 8 goals in 9 games in the tournament.[245] On 14 October, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–2 draw against Hungary in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, reaching a record 41 goals in World Cup qualifying.[246]

Player profile
Style of play

At his peak, Ronaldo was known for his exceptional speed, explosive shooting, flair and athleticism.[247]
A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[248] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[249] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[250][251] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[252] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[253]

His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[254][255][256] Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring 2.93 metres (9 ft 7 in), which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013.[257] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[250][254]

In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[254] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[254] An accurate penalty kick taker,[258] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[259] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[260] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[261] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: "People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him."[262]


As Ronaldo entered his thirties he dribbled less frequently,[263] instead transitioning into a "deadly poacher".[264]
At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[265] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[265][266][267] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[268][269][270] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a "false", "attacking", or "goalscoring winger", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[266][271] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[265][272][273] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[274][275][276]

In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[277][278] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[279][280][281] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[278]

Reception and image

Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Argentina forward Lionel Messi.[282] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[283] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[284] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[285] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[286] In a 2018 article for Bleacher Report, former NBA star Steve Nash compared Ronaldo to Michael Jordan: "On the pitch, [Ronaldo's] learned how to make his play—less explosive in individual movements—more successful for the team, and in that, I see the greatness of Jordan." In the same article, Ronaldo was ranked first in the ranking of the 50 most influential people in sports culture for 2018.[287]

"In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player."

—Former manager Alex Ferguson, January 2013[288]
Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[289][290] On his longevity and "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: "Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game."[263] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that "there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it."[291] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring.[292] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[293] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[294] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[295] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to "his relative immobility" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[296]

During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an "arrogant image" on the pitch,[297] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[298] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[297] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[298] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[299][300][301]

Goal celebrations

Ronaldo's "siu" celebration
Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[302][303][304] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion"[303] into his "signature power stance",[304] while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes").[302][305] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Siu" or siuuu in the media.[302][303][306] It has also been known as "suiii", "siiuuu", "siii" or "Right Here Right Now", formally the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration. Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013,[307] it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association football celebration of all time.[308]

The gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the 2013 International Champions Cup Final between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with a free kick when he headed in a cross from Isco, helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim the International Champions Cup and celebrating with his first "Siuuu". During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and "it just felt natural" and "didn't know where it came from". He started doing it more often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him.[309]

The phrase "siu" is derived from Portuguese sim, meaning "yes". This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase "Siuuu" simply means yes, but "meaning it very strongly".[310]

Rivalry with Lionel Messi
Main article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry

Ronaldo with Lionel Messi before an international friendly between Portugal and Argentina in 2011
Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals, have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[311] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[312][313] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[314] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[315][316][317]

"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."

—Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi.[318]
In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."[319] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best."[320] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano."[321] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players." Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."[318] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[322]

In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other." Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's "commander" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[323] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: "I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football."[324]

In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and "gone", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".[325]

Ronaldo was named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[326] ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.[327][328][329][330] Demand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product.[331] In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt.[332] In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.[333]

Ronaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers.[334] The most-followed person on Facebook (171 million), most-followed on Instagram (650 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (115 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017.[335]

After announcing the creation of his YouTube channel, UR · Cristiano on 21 August 2024, it became the fastest to reach the 1 million subscribers milestone,[336] doing so in 90 minutes.[336][337][338][339] The channel also became the fastest to reach 5,[340] 10,[341] 20,[342] 30 and 50 million subscribers.[343] It also became the most subscribed channel in Portugal, surpassing the Portuguese Nick Jr.[344] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[345]

Wealth and sponsorships
With earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.[346] Forbes ranked Ronaldo as the highest-paid ahtlete in the world in 2016 ($88 million), 2017 ($93 million) and from 2023 to 2025 ($136 million, $260 million and $275 million respectively), and he has entered every top 10 since the ranking's inception in 2012.[347][348][349][350][335] He has also been included in every annual ranking of the highest-paid athletes by Sportico: he was named the third highest-paid athlete of 2021 ($120 million) and 2022 ($115 million) and the highest-paid athlete of 2023 ($275 million) and 2024 ($260 million).[351][352][353] He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.[354]

Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012[355] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013.[355][356] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[357] Since his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition,[358] soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games.[359][360][361][362] Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion.[363] His "Sii" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover.[302] He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.[364]

Philanthropy

Ronaldo in 2010
Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[365][366] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[367]

In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[368] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.[369]

In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[370] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's "11 for Health" programme to raise awareness among kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity.[371] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[372] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for the Mangrove Care Forum Bali in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[373]

Ronaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[374] In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition.[374] In August of the same year, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.[375]

Eponyms and honours
See also: Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport, Museu CR7, and Galaxy CR7

The Cristiano Ronaldo Museum, Museu CR7, in Funchal, Madeira, opened in December 2013.
In 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus).[376] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia;[377] the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira.[378][379] At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry "to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations."[380] In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.[381]

On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[382] The name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[383][384] On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.[385][386] In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is "a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city".[387]

Public art


Public artwork of Ronaldo include a waxwork likeness in Madame Tussauds, London (left) and a bronze statue in Madeira (right), resembling the pose he strikes before taking free kicks.
In June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer, after Steven Gerrard, Pelé, and David Beckham, to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London.[388] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013.[389] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal in December 2014.[390][391]

The unveiling of the rebranded Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[384] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[392][384] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust;[393] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[394]

Business ventures
Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008.[395] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013.[396] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014.[397][398]

In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, "Legacy", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.[399] Since 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manhã, Record and Jornal de Negócios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Expressão Livre.[400] In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[401] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.[402]

Media
Ronaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007.[403] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011.[314] Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[404] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.[405][406] He appears as a playable character in the 2025 fighting game Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves.[407]

Personal life
Family, children, and relationships
Ronaldo is a Catholic.[408] Within his ancestry, he is of (one-eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother.[409] His father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[410] After her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.[411][412]

Ronaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[413] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[414][415] Ronaldo Jr. is a youth footballer who plays for Portugal Under-15s.[416] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[417] Then, in 2017, Ronaldo became a father to twins,[418] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy.

Ronaldo is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez,[419] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[420] The couple expected another set of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[421] On 11 August 2025, Rodríguez announced their engagement via Instagram.[422]

Health
Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol,[367] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[423] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[424]

Legal issues
In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[425] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[426]

Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[427]

In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[428][429] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[428][430] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an "intentional defamation campaign" with parts significantly "altered and/or completely fabricated",[431][432] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[433]

In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: "Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt."[434] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[435] The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo.[436]

In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, "acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute" the case, despite the documents containing "privileged communications" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having "intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement" during the 2010 settlement with her.[437] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of "cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents" were actions representing "abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process".[435][438]

 Varies between 1.85 and 1.89 metres by source. FIFA gives 1.85,[3] Real Madrid 1.87,[4] and the Portuguese Football Federation 1.89.[5]
 Although there was no third-place playoff, both losing semi-finalists (Germany and Portugal) were awarded bronze medals by UEFA.[6]
 The terminology for the award has varied. Ronaldo received three Ballons d'Or as awarded by France Football magazine (2008, 2016, 2017) and two FIFA Ballons d'Or (2013, 2014) as well as the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year and 2016 and 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player awards.

Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[1] Major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, love, and death.[2]

Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature,[3][4] though the books have received mixed reviews from critics and literary scholars. As of February 2023, the books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, available in dozens of languages. The last four books all set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release. It holds the Guinness World Record for "Best-selling book series for children."[5]

Warner Bros. Pictures adapted the original seven books into an eight-part namesake film series. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[6] making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling. A television series based on the books is in production at HBO.

The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Destinations & Experiences amusement parks around the world.

Plot
Further information: Fictional universe of Harry Potter
Early years
"The Elephant House", a small, painted red café where Rowling wrote a few chapters of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
The Elephant House was one of the cafés in Edinburgh where Rowling wrote the first part of Harry Potter.
The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US), Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin, who all treat him poorly. At the age of 11, Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who gives him a letter of acceptance to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents, Lily and James Potter, also had magical powers and were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when Harry was a baby. When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded, seemingly killing Voldemort, and Harry survived with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. The event made Harry famous among the community of wizards and witches.

Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts and is sorted into Gryffindor House. He gains the friendship of Ron Weasley, a member of a large but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch of non-magical, or Muggle, parentage. The trio develop an enmity with the rich pure-blood student Draco Malfoy. Harry encounters the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore; the potions professor, Severus Snape, who displays a dislike for him; and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell. Quirrell turns out to be allied with Voldemort, who is still alive as a weak spirit. The first book concludes with Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to possess the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describes Harry's second year at Hogwarts. Students are attacked and petrified by an unknown creature; wizards of Muggle parentage are the primary targets. The attacks appear related to the mythical Chamber of Secrets and resemble attacks fifty years earlier. Harry discovers an ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue, which he learns is rare and associated with the Dark Arts. When Hermione is attacked and Ron's younger sister Ginny Weasley is abducted, Harry and Ron uncover the chamber's secrets and enter it. Harry discovers that Ginny was possessed by an old diary, inside which the memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle, Voldemort's younger self, resides. On Voldemort's behalf, Ginny opened the chamber and unleashed the basilisk, an ancient monster that kills or petrifies those who make direct or indirect eye contact, respectively. With the help of Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, and the Sword of Gryffindor, Harry slays the basilisk and destroys the diary.

In the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry learns that he is targeted by Sirius Black, an escaped convict who allegedly assisted in his parents' murder. Dementors, creatures that feed on happiness, search for Sirius and guard the school. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a new professor who teaches him the Patronus charm. On a windy night, Ron is dragged by a black dog into the Shrieking Shack, a haunted house, and Harry and Hermione follow. The dog is revealed to be Sirius Black. Lupin enters the shack and explains that Sirius was James Potter's best friend; he was framed by another friend of James, Peter Pettigrew, who hides as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. As the full moon rises, Lupin transforms into a werewolf and bounds away, and the group chase after him. They are surrounded by dementors, but are saved by a figure resembling James who casts a stag Patronus. This is later revealed to be a future version of Harry, who travelled back in time with Hermione using a device called a Time Turner. The duo help Sirius escape on a Hippogriff, while Pettigrew escapes.

Voldemort returns

In Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), Hogwarts hosts the Triwizard Tournament, a contest between Hogwarts and the schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Harry is unwillingly entered into the contest, becoming Hogwarts' second participant after Cedric Diggory, an unusual occurrence that causes his friends to distance themselves from him. Harry claims the Triwizard Cup with Cedric, but he is teleported to a graveyard where Pettigrew kills Cedric, then resurrects Voldemort using Harry's blood. Voldemort convenes his supporters, the Death Eaters, and Harry manages to escape after a duel with Voldemort. Upon returning to Hogwarts, it is revealed that a Death Eater, Barty Crouch, Jr, in disguise as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, engineered Harry's entry into the tournament, secretly helped him, and had him teleported to Voldemort.

In the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned. Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society to counter Voldemort; meanwhile, the Ministry tightens control of Hogwarts by appointing Dolores Umbridge as High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, and she gradually increases her powers. When Umbridge bans practical teaching of Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry, Ron and Hermione form "Dumbledore's Army", a secret group to continue the teachings. Harry has recurring dreams of a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic, eventually dreaming that Sirius is being tortured there. He races to the Ministry with his friends, but it is a trap, planted in his head by Voldemort. The group are attacked by Death Eaters and saved by the Order of the Phoenix, but Sirius is killed in the battle. A duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort convinces the ministry of Voldemort's return. A prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort is revealed: one must die at the hands of the other.

In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Snape teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts while Horace Slughorn becomes the Potions master. Harry finds an old textbook with annotations by the Half-Blood Prince, due to which he achieves success in Potions class. Harry also takes private sessions with Dumbledore, viewing memories about the early life of Voldemort in a device called a Pensieve. Harry learns from a drunken Slughorn that he used to teach Tom Riddle, and that Voldemort divided his soul into pieces, creating a series of Horcruxes. Harry and Dumbledore travel to a distant lake to destroy a Horcrux; they succeed, but Dumbledore weakens. On their return, they find Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters attacking the school. The book ends with the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, Lord Voldemort gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione learn about the Deathly Hallows, legendary items that lead to mastery over death. The group infiltrates the ministry, where they steal a locket Horcrux, and visit Godric's Hollow, where they are attacked by Nagini, Voldemort's snake. A silver doe Patronus leads them to the Sword of Gryffindor, with which they destroy the locket. They steal a Horcrux from Gringotts and travel to Hogwarts, culminating in a battle with the Death Eaters. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia, but he lends Harry his memories before he dies. Harry learns that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore, and that Harry is himself a Horcrux. Harry surrenders to Voldemort and is hit with the killing curse; however he is not killed as the protection Lily gave him lives on within Voldemort since he used Harry's blood to resurrect himself . The defenders of Hogwarts continue to fight on; Harry comes back from limbo, faces Voldemort and kills him.

An epilogue titled "Nineteen Years Later" describes the lives of the surviving characters and the impact of Voldemort's death. Harry and Ginny are married with three children, and Ron and Hermione are married with two children.

Style and allusions
Genre and style
The novels fall into the genre of fantasy literature, and qualify as a type of fantasy called "urban fantasy", "contemporary fantasy", or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the bildungsroman, or coming of age novel,[7] and contain elements of mystery, adventure, horror, thriller, and romance. The books are also, in the words of Stephen King, "shrewd mystery tales",[8] and each book is constructed in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery adventure. The stories are told from a third person limited point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of Philosopher's Stone, Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the first two chapters of Half-Blood Prince).

The series can be considered part of the British children's boarding school genre, which includes Rudyard Kipling's Stalky & Co., Enid Blyton's Malory Towers, St. Clare's and the Naughtiest Girl series, and Frank Richards's Billy Bunter novels: the Harry Potter books are predominantly set in Hogwarts, a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of magic.[9] In this sense they are "in a direct line of descent from Thomas Hughes's Tom Brown's School Days and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of British public school life", though they are, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than the typical boarding school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love, loss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss of innocence in a 1990s British setting.[10][11][failed verification]

In Harry Potter, Rowling juxtaposes the extraordinary against the ordinary.[12] Her narrative features two worlds: a contemporary world inhabited by non-magical people called Muggles, and another featuring wizards. It differs from typical portal fantasy in that its magical elements stay grounded in the mundane.[13] Paintings move and talk; books bite readers; letters shout messages; and maps show live journeys, making the wizarding world both exotic and familiar.[12][14] This blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling's characters. Their names are often onomatopoeic[clarification needed]: Malfoy is difficult, Filch is unpleasant, and Lupin is a werewolf.[15][16] Harry is ordinary and relatable, with down-to-earth features such as wearing broken glasses;[17] the scholar Roni Natov terms him an "everychild".[18] These elements serve to highlight Harry when he is heroic, making him both an everyman and a fairytale hero.[17][19]

Each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year. Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes a matter of life and death—a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books.[20][21] In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.[20]

Allusions
The Harry Potter stories feature imagery and motifs drawn from Arthurian myth and fairytales. Harry's ability to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat resembles the Arthurian sword in the stone legend.[22] His life with the Dursleys has been compared to Cinderella.[23] Hogwarts resembles a medieval university-cum-castle with several professors who belong to an Order of Merlin; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289; and a real historical person, a 14th-century scribe, Sir Nicolas Flamel, is described as a holder of the Philosopher's Stone.[24] Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats-of-arms and medieval weapons on the walls, letters written on parchment and sealed with wax, the Great Hall of Hogwarts, which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot, the use of Latin phrases, the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments, which are similar to the "marvellous tents" put up for knightly tournaments, imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns that exist around Hogwarts, and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts.[24]

Many of the motifs of the Potter stories, such as the hero's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility, magical animals and trees, a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars, are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances.[24] Other aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers, werewolves as characters, and white deer.[24] The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th-century French Arthurian romance, Claris et Laris, writing of the "startling" similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris.[24] Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards.[24]

Like C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter also contains Christian symbolism and allegory. The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul.[25] Children's literature critic Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ.[26] Comparing Rowling with Lewis, she argues that "magic is both authors' way of talking about spiritual reality".[27] According to Maria Nikolajeva, Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series: Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an "ecce homo" speech, after which Harry is resurrected and defeats his enemy.[28]

Rowling stated that she did not reveal Harry Potter's religious parallels in the beginning because doing so would have "give[n] too much away to fans who might then see the parallels".[29] In the final book of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Rowling makes the book's Christian imagery more explicit, quoting both Matthew 6:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:26 (King James Version) when Harry visits his parents' graves.[29] Hermione Granger teaches Harry Potter that the meaning of these verses from the Christian Bible are "living beyond death. Living after death", which Rowling states "epitomize the whole series".[29][30][31] Rowling also exhibits Christian values in developing Albus Dumbledore as a God-like character, the divine, trusted leader of the series, guiding the long-suffering hero along his quest. In the seventh novel, Harry speaks with and questions the deceased Dumbledore much like a person of faith would talk to and question God.[32][full citation needed]

Themes
J.K. Rowling, a blond, blue-eyed woman, who is the author of the series
The novelist, J. K. Rowling
Harry Potter's overarching theme is death.[33][34] In the first book, when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and "a terrible sadness" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him.[35] Confronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with Dementors.[35][36] Other characters in Harry's life die; he even faces his own death in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[37] The series has an existential perspective—Harry must grow mature enough to accept death.[38] In Harry's world, death is not binary but mutable, a state that exists in degrees.[39] Unlike Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts, Harry's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love.[38]

Love distinguishes Harry and Voldemort. Harry is a hero because he loves others, even willing to accept death to save them; Voldemort is a villain because he does not.[40] Harry carries the protection of his mother's sacrifice in his blood; Voldemort, who wants Harry's blood and the protection it carries, does not understand that love vanquishes death.[26]

Rowling has spoken about thematising death and loss in the series. Soon after she started writing Philosopher's Stone, her mother died; she said that "I really think from that moment on, death became a central, if not the central theme of the seven books".[41] Rowling has described Harry as "the prism through which I view death", and further stated that "all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death".[42]

While Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good vs. evil, its moral divisions are not absolute.[43][44] First impressions of characters are often misleading. Harry assumes in the first book that Quirrell is on the side of good because he opposes Snape, who appears to be malicious; in reality, Quirrell is an agent of Voldemort, while Snape is loyal to Dumbledore. This pattern later recurs with Moody and Snape.[43] In Rowling's world, good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and the possibility of redemption are key themes of the series.[45][46] This is reflected in Harry's self-doubts after learning his connections to Voldemort, such as Parseltongue;[45] and prominently in Snape's characterisation, which has been described as complex and multifaceted.[47] In some scholars' view, while Rowling's narrative appears on the surface to be about Harry, her focus may actually be on Snape's morality and character arc.[48][49]

Rowling said that, to her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious". In the fourth book, Dumbledore speaks of a "choice between what is right and what is easy"; Rowling views this as a key theme, "because that ... is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble".[50]

Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.[51] Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and "going over one's most harrowing ordeals—and thus coming to terms with them" has also been considered.[52] Rowling has stated that the books comprise "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry" and that they also pass on a message to "question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth".[53]

Development history
Main article: Harry Potter influences and analogues
In 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry suddenly "fell into" her head. Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:[54]

I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.

Rowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 1995 and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents.[55] The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to several publishers.[56]

Publishing history

After twelve other publishers had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book.[58] Despite Rowling's statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven.[59] On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.[60][61]

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published by Bloomsbury, the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom, on 26 June 1997.[62] It was published in the United States on 1 September 1998 by Scholastic—the American publisher of the books—as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,[63] after the American rights sold for US$105,000—a record amount for a children's book by an unknown author.[64] Scholastic feared that American readers would not associate the word "philosopher" with magic, and Rowling suggested the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the American market.[65] Rowling has later said that she regrets the change.[66]

The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[67] Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[68] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series, at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[69] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[70] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005.[71][72] The seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published on 21 July 2007.[73] Rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book (in fact, the epilogue) was completed "in something like 1990".[74]

Rowling retained rights to digital editions and released them on the Pottermore website in 2012. Vendors such as Amazon displayed the ebooks in the form of links to Pottermore, which controlled pricing.[75] All seven Harry Potter novels have been released in unabridged audiobook versions, with Stephen Fry reading the British editions and Jim Dale voicing the series for the American editions.[76][77] On Audible, the series has been listened to, as of November 2022, for over a billion hours.[78]

Translations
Main article: Harry Potter in translation

The Russian translation of The Deathly Hallows goes on sale in Moscow, 2007
The series has been translated into more than 80 languages,[79] placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history. The books have seen translations to diverse languages such as Korean, Armenian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Bulgarian, Welsh, Afrikaans, Albanian, Latvian, Vietnamese and Hawaiian. The first volume has been translated into Latin and even Ancient Greek,[80] making it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of Heliodorus of Emesa in the 3rd century AD.[81] The second volume has also been translated into Latin.[82]

Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well-known authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.[83] For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.[84]

The United States editions were adapted into American English to make them more understandable to a young American audience.[85]

Cover art
For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold.[86] The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.[87]

Due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket on the cover of the final book.[citation needed]

International and later editions have been created by a range of designers, including Mary GrandPré for US audiences and Mika Launis in Finland.[88][89] For a later American release, Kazu Kibuishi created covers in a somewhat anime-influenced style.[90][91]

The popularity of the Harry Potter series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other Harry Potter related licence holders. This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author.[92] The books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular film adaptations produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, all of which have been highly successful in their own right.[93][79] The total revenue from the book sales is estimated, as of November 2018, to be around $7.7 billion.[94] The first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it one of the bestselling books in history.[95][96] The films have in turn spawned eight video games and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products. The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $25 billion.[6]

The great demand for Harry Potter novels motivated The New York Times to create a separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. By 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list.[97] On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[98] For the release of Goblet of Fire, 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book.[99] Together, Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book.[99] In the United States, the book's initial printing run was 3.8 million copies.[99] This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with 8.5 million, which was then shattered by Half-Blood Prince with 10.8 million copies.[100] Within the first 24 hours of its release, 6.9 million copies of Prince were sold in the US; in the UK more than two million copies were sold on the first day.[101] The initial US print run for Deathly Hallows was 12 million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.[102]

Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours.[103][104] The final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the fastest selling book in history, moving 11 million units in the first twenty-four hours of release.[105] The book sold 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[72] The series has also gathered adult fans, leading to the release of two editions of each Harry Potter book, identical in text but with one edition's cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults.[106]

Literary criticism
Early in its history, Harry Potter received positive reviews. On publication, the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as The Scotsman, which said it had "all the makings of a classic",[108] and The Glasgow Herald, which called it "Magic stuff".[108] Soon the English newspapers joined in, with The Sunday Times comparing it to Roald Dahl's work ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"),[108] while The Guardian called it "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit".[108]

By the time of the release of the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the books began to receive strong criticism from literary scholars. Yale professor, literary scholar, and critic Harold Bloom raised criticisms of the books' literary merits, saying, "Rowling's mind is so governed by clichés and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing."[109] A. S. Byatt authored an op-ed article in The New York Times calling Rowling's universe a "secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children's literature ... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip."[110]

Michael Rosen, a novelist and poet, held the opinion that the books were not suited for children, as they would be unable to grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that "J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer."[111] The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was negative—"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain", and he speaks of "a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style".[112] Ursula K. Le Guin said, "I have no great opinion of it [...] it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a 'school novel,' good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited."[113] By contrast, author Fay Weldon, while admitting that the series is "not what the poets hoped for", nevertheless goes on to say, "but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose".[114]

The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times, stating, "There are not many writers who have JK's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep—openly, with tears splashing—and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes ... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written."[115] Charles Taylor of Salon.com, who is primarily a movie critic,[116] took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have "a valid cultural point—a teeny one—about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art",[117] he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers.[117] Stephen King called the series "a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable", and declared "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" to be "remarkable". However, he wrote that he is "a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books.[8][118]

Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying "It depresses me to see 16- and 17-year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas."[119] The Washington Post book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that "through no fault of Rowling's", the cultural and marketing "hysteria" marked by the publication of the later books "trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide".[120] Jenny Sawyer wrote in The Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that Harry Potter neither faces a "moral struggle" nor undergoes any ethical growth and is thus "no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white".[121] In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to Platform 9+3⁄4 as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes.[122]

In an 8 November 2002, Slate article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a "trust-fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him".[123] In a 12 August 2007 review of Deathly Hallows in The New York Times, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for "unmooring" her "English school story" from literary precedents "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created "a world of youthful democracy and diversity".[124] In 2016, an article written by Diana C. Mutz compared the politics of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how Americans have responded to the campaign.[125]

There is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.[126]

Thematic critique
The portrayal of women in Harry Potter has been described as complex and varied, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender.[127] Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society. However, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles.[128] According to scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series. The final three books "showcase richer roles and more powerful females": for instance, the series' "most matriarchal character", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, while other women are shown as leaders.[129] Hermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists' battle against evil.[130] Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles,[131] and Hermione's status as a feminist model is debated.[132] Girls and women are more frequently shown as emotional, more often defined by their appearance, and less often given agency in family settings.[128][133]

The social hierarchy of wizards in Rowling's world has drawn debate among critics. "Purebloods" have two wizard parents; "half-bloods" have one; and "Muggle-born" wizards have magical abilities, although neither of their parents is a wizard.[134] Lord Voldemort and his followers believe that blood purity is paramount and that Muggles are subhuman.[135] According to the literary scholar Andrew Blake, Harry Potter rejects blood purity as a basis for social division;[136] Suman Gupta agrees that Voldemort's philosophy represents "absolute evil";[137] and Nel and Eccleshare agree that advocates of racial or blood-based hierarchies are antagonists.[138][139] Gupta, following Blake,[140] suggests that the essential superiority of wizards over Muggles—wizards can use magic and Muggles cannot—means that the books cannot coherently reject anti-Muggle prejudice by appealing to equality between wizards and Muggles. Rather, according to Gupta, Harry Potter models a form of tolerance based on the "charity and altruism of those belonging to superior races" towards lesser races.[141]

Harry Potter's's depiction of race, specifically the slavery of house-elves, has received varied responses. Scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement.[142][143] Other critics including Farah Mendlesohn find the portrayal of house-elves "most difficult to accept": the elves are denied the right to free themselves and rely on the benevolence of others like Hermione.[144][145] Pharr terms the house-elves a disharmonious element in the series, writing that Rowling leaves their fate hanging;[146] at the end of Deathly Hallows, the elves remain enslaved and cheerful.[147] The goblins of the world of Harry Potter have also received criticism for following antisemitic caricatures – particularly for their grotesque "hook-nosed" portrayal in the films, an appearance associated with Jewish stereotypes.[148][149][150]

Controversies
Main articles: Legal disputes over the Harry Potter series, Religious debates over the Harry Potter series, Politics of Harry Potter, and Tanya Grotter
The books have been the subject of legal proceedings, stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements. The popularity and high market value of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor Warner Bros. to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of Harry Potter imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the "Harry Potter" domain name, and suing author Nancy Stouffer to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work.[151][152][153]

Various religious fundamentalists have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as Wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children,[154][155][156] while critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas.[157][158] The series has landed the American Library Associations' Top 10 Banned Book List in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2019 with claims it was anti-family, discussed magic and witchcraft, contained actual spells and curses, referenced the occult/Satanism, violence, and had characters who used "nefarious means" to attain goals, as well as conflicts with religious viewpoints.[159]

The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds. From 1997 to 1998, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won almost all the United Kingdom awards judged by children, but none of the children's book awards judged by adults,[160] and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children.[161] In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children's division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaney's translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.[161]

In 2000, shortly before the publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the previous three Harry Potter books topped The New York Times fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were children's books. The newspaper created a new children's section covering children's books, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only hardback sales. The move was supported by publishers and booksellers.[97] In 2004, The New York Times further split the children's list, which was still dominated by Harry Potter books, into sections for series and individual books and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books.[162] The split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move.[163] Time suggested that, on the same principle, Billboard should have created a separate "mop-tops" list in 1964 when The Beatles held the top five places in its list, and Nielsen should have created a separate game-show list when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? dominated the ratings.[164]

Legacy
Influence on literature

Harry Potter transformed children's literature.[165][166] In the 1970s, children's books were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic,[167] while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of The Lord of the Rings.[168] The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.[169][170]

The commercial success of Harry Potter reversed this trend.[171] The scale of its growth had no precedent in the children's market: within four years of the series' inception, it occupied 28% of that field by revenue.[172] Children's literature rose in cultural status,[173] and fantasy became a dominant genre.[174] Older works in the genre, including Diana Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci series and Diane Duane's Young Wizards, were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established their careers.[175] In the following decades, many Harry Potter imitators and subversive responses grew popular.[176][177]

Rowling has been compared to Enid Blyton, who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children's market.[178][179] She has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl.[180] Some critics view Harry Potter's rise, along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure.[181] This is reflected in the BBC's 2003 "Big Read" survey of the UK's favourite books, where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers 3 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top 10.[182]

Cultural impact

Harry Potter has been described as a cultural phenomenon.[183][184] The word "Muggle" has spread beyond its origins in the books, entering the Oxford English Dictionary in 2003.[185] A real-life version of the sport Quidditch was created in 2005 and featured as an exhibition tournament in the 2012 London Olympics.[186] Characters and elements from the series have inspired scientific names of several organisms, including the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia, the spider Eriovixia gryffindori, the wasp Ampulex dementor, and the crab Harryplax severus.[187]

Librarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books' potential to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would.[188] The seven-book series has a word count of 1,083,594 (US edition). Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with "the qualities of highbrow literary fiction", but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandise that accompanies the book launches.[189] However, the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is "largely a folk legend".[190]

Research by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books.[190][191] The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres.[190] NEA chairman Dana Gioia said the series, "got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books. The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading."[192]

Many fan fiction and fan art works about Harry Potter have been made. In March 2007, "Harry Potter" was the most commonly searched fan fiction subject on the internet.[193] Jennifer Conn used Snape's and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch's teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching,[194] and Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: "sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory".[195]

From the early 2000s onwards, several news reports appeared in the UK of the Harry Potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls,[196] and even reports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now being abandoned by their owners.[197] This led J. K. Rowling to issue several statements urging Harry Potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls.[198] Despite the media flurry, research into the popularity of Harry Potter and sales of owls in the UK failed to find any evidence that the Harry Potter franchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of owls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries.[199]

By 2003, a sign marking Platform 9 3/4 was put up at the London King's Cross railway station,[200][201][202] with a trolley fixed to the wall added by the year 2005.[203][204] The location of the trolley moved after renovations, and a Harry Potter-themed shop opened nearby in 2012.[205][206][207] Prince Charles visited the location in 2013.[208]

1 September, the day Harry Potter generally started school at Hogwarts, became known to fans as "Back to Hogwarts Day",[209][210] gaining more prominence starting in 2015 when J.K. Rowling suggested on social media that it was the year Harry Potter would be starting to send off his own children to Hogwarts, though in 2016 she later acknowledged that she was wrong by a year regarding the King's Cross events in the epilogue.[211][212][213] On the date in 2024, fans showed up at King's Cross Station even though no event was held and fans were discouraged from attending, reportedly due to crowding issues the year before, and booed when no Hogwarts Express announcement was made at 11 a.m. as in previous years.[214][215] Organisers had encouraged fans to participate in virtual events, while in-person events were held at other locations like Grand Central Terminal in New York City and Hamburg, Germany.[216][217][218]

British book publisher Bloomsbury announced the launch of "Harry Potter Book Night" and associated promotional events in 2014, first held in February 2015.[219][220][221] In 2023, the event was rebranded to "Harry Potter Book Day" and moved to October.[222][223]

Awards, honours, and recognition
Further information: List of awards and nominations received by J. K. Rowling
The Harry Potter series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of Philosopher's Stone, including a platinum award from the Whitaker Gold and Platinum Book Awards (2001),[224][225] three Nestlé Smarties Book Prizes (1997–1999),[226] two Scottish Arts Council Book Awards (1999 and 2001),[227] the inaugural Whitbread children's book of the year award (1999),[228] and the WHSmith book of the year (2006),[229] among others. In 2000, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel, and in 2001, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won said award.[230] Honours include a commendation for the Carnegie Medal (1997),[231] a short listing for the Guardian Children's Award (1998), and numerous listings on the notable books, editors' choices, and best books lists of the American Library Association, The New York Times, Chicago Public Library, and Publishers Weekly.[232]

In 2002, sociologist Andrew Blake named Harry Potter a British pop culture icon along with the likes of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.[233] In 2003, four of the books were named in the top 24 of the BBC's The Big Read survey of the best loved novels in the UK.[234] A 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read aloud in elementary schools in San Diego County, California.[235] Based on a 2007 online poll, the US National Education Association listed the series in its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".[236] Time magazine named Rowling as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year award, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fandom.[237] Three of the books placed among the "Top 100 Chapter Books" of all time, or children's novels, in a 2012 survey published by School Library Journal: Sorcerer's Stone ranked number three, Prisoner of Azkaban 12th, and Goblet of Fire 98th.[238]

In 2007, the seven Harry Potter book covers were depicted on a series of UK postage stamps issued by Royal Mail.[239] In 2012, the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London featured a 100-foot tall rendition of Lord Voldemort in a segment designed to showcase the UK's cultural icons.[240] In November 2019, the BBC listed the Harry Potter series on its list of the 100 most influential novels.[241]

In 1999, Rowling sold the film rights for Harry Potter to Warner Bros. for a reported £1 million (US$2,000,000).[242][243] Rowling had creative control on the film series, observing the filmmaking process of Philosopher's Stone and serving as producer on the two-part Deathly Hallows, alongside David Heyman and David Barron.[244] Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British and Irish, nonetheless allowing for the inclusion or French and Eastern European actors where characters from the book are specified as such.[245]

Chris Columbus was selected as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (titled "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the United States).[246] Philosopher's Stone was released on 14 November 2001. Just three days after the film's release, production for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, also directed by Columbus, began and the film was released on 15 November 2002.[247] Columbus declined to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, only acting as producer. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón took over the job, and after shooting in 2003, the film was released on 4 June 2004. Due to the fourth film beginning its production before the third's release, Mike Newell was chosen as the director for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, released on 18 November 2005.[248] Newell became the first British director of the series, with television director David Yates following suit after he was chosen to helm Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Production began in January 2006 and the film was released the following year in July 2007.[249] Yates was selected to direct Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which was released on 15 July 2009.[250][251] The final instalment in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in two cinematic parts: Part 1 on 19 November 2010 and Part 2 on 15 July 2011.[252][253]

Spin-off prequels

A prequel series is planned to consist of five films, taking place before the main series.[254] The first film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was released in November 2016, followed by the second Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald in November 2018 and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in April 2022. Rowling wrote the screenplays for all three films,[255] marking her foray into screenwriting.

Games
See also: Harry Potter video games
Several non-interactive media games and board games have been released such as Cluedo Harry Potter Edition, Scene It? Harry Potter and Lego Harry Potter models, which are influenced by the themes of both the novels and films.

There are fourteen Harry Potter video games, eight corresponding with the films and books and six spin-offs. The film/book-based games are produced by Electronic Arts (EA), as was Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup, with the game version of the first entry in the series, Philosopher's Stone, being released in November 2001. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone went on to become one of the best-selling PlayStation games ever.[256] The video games were released to coincide with the films. Objectives usually occur in and around Hogwarts. The story and design of the games follow the selected film's characterisation and plot; EA worked closely with Warner Bros. to include scenes from the films. The last game in the series, Deathly Hallows, was split, with Part 1 released in November 2010 and Part 2 debuting on consoles in July 2011.[257][258]

The spin-off games Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4 and Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7 were developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The spin-off games Book of Spells and Book of Potions were developed by London Studio and use the Wonderbook, an augmented reality book designed to be used in conjunction with the PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye.[259] The Harry Potter universe, the Wizarding World, is also featured in Lego Dimensions, with the settings and side characters featured in the Harry Potter Adventure World, and Harry, Voldemort, and Hermione as playable characters. In 2017, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment opened its own Harry Potter-themed game design studio, by the name of Portkey Games, before releasing Hogwarts Mystery, developed by Jam City, in 2018 and Hogwarts Legacy, developed by Avalanche Software, in 2023.[260][261]

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child playing at the West End's Palace Theatre
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts I and II is a play which serves as a sequel to the books, beginning nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was written by Jack Thorne based on an original new story by Thorne, Rowling and John Tiffany.[262] It has run at the Palace Theatre in London's West End since previews began on 7 June 2016 with an official premiere on 30 June 2016.[263] The first four months of tickets for the June–September performances were sold out within several hours upon release.[264] Forthcoming productions are planned for Broadway[265] and Melbourne.[266]

The script was released as a book at the time of the premiere, with a revised version following the next year.

Television
Main article: Harry Potter (TV series)
On 25 January 2021, it was reported that a live-action television series has been in early development at HBO Max. Though it was noted that the series has "complicated rights issues", due to a seven-year rights deal with Warner Bros. Domestic TV Distribution that included US broadcast, cable and streaming rights to the franchise, which ended in April 2025.[267] On 12 April 2023, the series was confirmed to be in development, and will be streamed on the new streaming service Max (formerly known as HBO Max).[268][269][270] On 23 February 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced that the series would debut on Max in 2026. On 25 June 2024, it was announced the series was moved from Max to HBO.[271] The series is planned to adapt one book per season, with seven seasons planned.[272]

An open casting call for the three leading young actors in the UK and Ireland was announced in September 2024, with Variety reporting that 32,000 children auditioned for the roles, with filming to start in summer 2025.[273][274][275] In November 2024, it was reported that Mark Rylance was the front runner to play Dumbledore in the series.[276] On 25 February 2025, American actor John Lithgow confirmed reports that he had been cast as Dumbledore in the series.[277][278] He acknowledged there would be controversy over him playing the role as an American, when the film series only cast British or Irish cast members at Rowling's request, and that he would work with a dialect coach. He also suggested filming would start in August after he finished portraying Roald Dahl on stage in London.[279] He said "I don't know the Harry Potter canon by heart as 98% of the world's population seems to," but said that in talks with the producers he was intrigued by how "as the kids grew older [in the books], you learn more and more about Dumbledore, and he became a much more surprising, complicated character."[280] He also said he had started reading the books in preparation.[281]

News reports also speculated in March 2025 that a casting notice seeking children as extras near Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden was for the new series.[282][283] On 7 March 2025, it was reported that English actor Paapa Essiedu and English actress Janet McTeer were in negotiations to portray Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall respectively in the series.[284] On 27 May 2025, it was announced that Dominic McLaughlin, Alastair Stout and Arabella Stanton were cast as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively.[285] On 9 June 2025, it was revealed that Bel Powley would play Petunia Dursley and Daniel Rigby would play Vernon Dursley.[286] It was also revealed that Lox Pratt would play Draco Malfoy, Johnny Flynn would play Lucius Malfoy, Katherine Parkinson would play Molly Weasley, Leo Earley would play Seamus Finnigan, Alessia Leoni would play Parvati Patil, Sienna Moosah would play Lavender Brown, and Bertie Carvel would play Cornelius Fudge.[287]

Full-cast audiobook
In 2024, it was announced that the novels would be adapted into full-cast audio productions with a voice cast of over 100 voice actors to be released in late 2025.[288] In August 2025, it was announced that the audio dramas would be released monthly, starting on 4 November 2025.[289]

Attractions

Hogwarts Castle as depicted in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, located in Universal Orlando Resort's Island of Adventure
Universal and Warner Bros. created The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a Harry Potter-themed expansion to the Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida. It opened to the public on 18 June 2010.[292] It includes a recreation of Hogsmeade and several rides; its flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which exists within a recreation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[293]

In 2014 Universal opened a Harry Potter-themed area at the Universal Studios Florida theme park. It includes a recreation of Diagon Alley.[294] The flagship attraction is the Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride.[295] A completely functioning full-scale replica of the Hogwarts Express was created for the Diagon Alley expansion, connecting King's Cross Station at Universal Studios to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure.[296][297] The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park near Los Angeles, California in 2016,[298][299] and in Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka, Japan in 2014. The Osaka venue includes the village of Hogsmeade, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride, and Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster.[300][301] Other Harry Potter roller coasters are the Dragon Challenge which closed to make way for Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, at Universal Islands of Adventure.

Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter is a behind-the-scenes walking tour in London featuring authentic sets, costumes and props from the film series. The attraction is located at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, where all eight of the Harry Potter films were made. Warner Bros. constructed two new sound stages to house and showcase the sets from each of the British-made productions, following a £100 million investment.[302] It opened to the public in March 2012.[303] A Japan based version of the studio tour was announced in August 2020 and opened on 16 June 2023.[304]

Supplementary works

Rowling expanded the Harry Potter universe with short books produced for charities.[305][306] In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch Through the Ages (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief.[307] In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned to raise money for the Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008.[308][309] Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones.[310] All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels.

In 2016, she released three new e-books: Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide, Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists and Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies.[311]

Rowling's website Pottermore was launched in 2012.[312] Pottermore allows users to be sorted, be chosen by their wand and play various minigames. The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey through the story with access to content not revealed by JK Rowling previously, with over 18,000 words of additional content.[313] The site was redesigned in 2015 as WizardingWorld and it mainly focuses on the information already available, rather than exploration.[314]

Lịch sử là nghiên cứu có hệ thống về quá khứ, tập trung chủ yếu vào quá khứ của loài người. Dưới hình thức một môn học, lịch sử phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng để tường thuật lại những gì đã xảy ra và giải thích lý do cũng như cách thức mà sự việc đó xảy ra. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội còn số khác xem đây là bộ phận của nhân văn học hoặc là một bộ môn hỗn hợp. Có nhiều tranh luận tương tự xoay quanh mục đích của lịch sử, chẳng hạn như liệu mục tiêu chính của nó là để khám phá chân lý (hướng lý thuyết) hay là rút ra bài học kinh nghiệm từ quá khứ (hướng thực tiễn). Theo cách hiểu suy rộng, ngoài ý nghĩa lĩnh vực học thuật, thuật ngữ lịch sử còn chỉ cả bản thân quá khứ, những thời điểm trong quá khứ hoặc các văn bản riêng lẻ liên quan đến quá khứ.

Nghiên cứu lịch sử phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tư liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp để tái hiện các sự kiện trong quá khứ và xác nhận diễn giải. Phê phán sử liệu là một phương pháp được sử dụng để đánh giá những nguồn này dựa trên tính xác thực, nội dung và độ tin cậy. Giới sử học thường cố gắng kết hợp quan điểm giữa nhiều nguồn tài liệu để tạo nên mạch tự sự thống nhất. Các trường phái tư tưởng khác nhau như chủ nghĩa thực chứng, trường phái Annales, chủ nghĩa Marx và chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại có cách tiếp cận phương pháp luận khác nhau.

Lịch sử là một bộ môn rộng bao gồm nhiều nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào các giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể (ví dụ như thời kỳ cổ đại), còn số khác hướng đến những khu vực địa lý nhất định (chẳng hạn như lịch sử châu Phi). Theo phạm vi lĩnh vực, lịch sử có thể được phân loại thành lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử quân sự, lịch sử xã hội, lịch sử kinh tế, v.v. Các phân nhánh theo loại tư liệu và phương pháp nghiên cứu bao gồm lịch sử định lượng, lịch sử so sánh và lịch sử truyền miệng.

Lịch sử ra đời dưới hình thức lĩnh vực nghiên cứu ở thời cổ đại thay thế những câu chuyện truyền thuyết, bắt nguồn chủ yếu ở Hy Lạp, Trung Quốc và sau này là thế giới Hồi giáo. Ghi chép lịch sử trải qua nhiều biến đổi theo thời gian và ngày càng có tính chuyên nghiệp cao, nhất là vào thế kỷ 19 với sự xuất hiện một phương pháp luận nghiêm ngặt cùng hàng loạt cơ sở học thuật được thành lập. Lịch sử có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực như sử luận, triết học, giáo dục và chính trị.

Định nghĩa
Theo sử gia Đào Duy Anh (1932), lịch sử (ánh xạ với tiếng Pháp histoire) được định nghĩa là "biên chép những sự biến thiên diên cách trải qua các đời" hoặc "biên chép những việc lớn của quốc gia, xã hội".[1]

Dưới dạng một bộ môn học thuật, lịch sử là ngành nghiên cứu về quá khứ, đặc biệt là quá khứ của loài người.[2] Mục tiêu của lịch sử là khái quát và tái hiện những gì đã xảy ra bằng cách thu thập và phân tích các bằng chứng để tổng hợp thành tường thuật. Những tường thuật này làm sáng tỏ diễn biến vụ việc, nguyên nhân hình thành và bối cảnh lịch sử cụ thể, qua đó giải thích điều kiện bối cảnh và cơ chế nhân quả liên quan đến chúng. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn phân tích ý nghĩa của những sự việc trong quá khứ và khám phá những động cơ đã thúc đẩy hành động của con người.[3]

Theo một định nghĩa khác, lịch sử chỉ bản thân các sự kiện trong quá khứ. Theo cách hiểu này, lịch sử chính là những gì đã xảy ra thay vì là môn học thuật nghiên cứu những điều đã xảy ra. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn có một nghĩa khác là ghi chép về quá khứ dưới hình thức văn bản. Văn bản lịch sử là sản phẩm văn hóa phản ánh quá trình lý giải và tái cấu trúc thường xuyên từ các nhà sử học. Cách tường thuật trong các văn bản lịch sử có thể thay đổi khi nhà sử học tìm thấy bằng chứng mới hoặc lý giải lại sử liệu hiện có. Trái lại, bản thân quá khứ là bất biến và không thể thay đổi.[4] Một số sử gia tập trung vào các khía cạnh lý giải và giải thích để phân biệt lịch sử với biên niên sử, với luận điểm rằng biên niên sử chỉ liệt kê các sự kiện theo trình tự thời gian còn lịch sử hướng đến hiểu biết toàn diện về nguyên nhân, bối cảnh đến hệ quả.[5]

Từ trước đến nay, lịch sử chủ yếu nghiên cứu những gì được con người ghi lại bằng chữ viết. Vì thế, môn này tập trung vào các sự kiện xảy ra sau khi con người phát minh ra chữ viết (gọi là lịch sử ghi chép), còn thời kỳ trước đó, gọi là thời tiền sử,[a] thường do ngành khảo cổ học nghiên cứu.[7] Tuy nhiên, sang thế kỷ 20, các nhà sử học đã mở rộng phạm vi và bắt đầu quan tâm nhiều hơn đến quá khứ của loài người trước thời điểm chữ viết ra đời.[8][b]

Giới sử học tranh luận về việc lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội hay là bộ phận của nhân văn học. Tương tự như với khoa học xã hội, nhà sử học xây dựng giả thuyết, thu thập bằng chứng khách quan và trình bày luận điểm dựa trên bằng chứng đó. Mặt khác, lịch sử cũng liên hệ chặt chẽ với nhân văn học vì phụ thuộc vào các khía cạnh chủ quan gắn liền với sự lý giải, kể chuyện, kinh nghiệm của con người và di sản văn hóa.[10] Một số sử gia ủng hộ phân loại theo chỉ một trong hai cách nêu trên, còn số khác xem lịch sử là một môn hỗn hợp không thuộc về phạm trù cụ thể nào theo hướng loại trừ với phạm trù còn lại.[11] Lịch sử đối lập với ngụy sử, một thuật ngữ chỉ sử luận lệch chuẩn do dùng bằng chứng lịch sử gây tranh cãi, cố tình bỏ qua bằng chứng đã xác thực hoặc sử dụng cách thức khác để bóp méo ghi chép lịch sử. Thường được thúc đẩy bởi một số ý thức hệ nhất định, ngụy sử bắt chước phương pháp lịch sử để truyền bá cách tường thuật thiên lệch, gây hiểu lầm, không dựa trên phân tích nghiêm ngặt và thiếu sự đồng thuận về mặt học thuật.[12]

Mục đích
Đã có nhiều ý kiến được đưa ra về mục đích hoặc giá trị của lịch sử. Một số sử gia cho rằng mục đích chính của lịch sử chỉ đơn giản là tìm ra chân lý về quá khứ. Theo quan điểm này, mưu cầu chân lý công tâm là một mục đích tự thân và không nên bị ảnh hưởng bởi những mục đích bên ngoài như chính trị hay ý thức hệ, vì như vậy có thể xuyên tạc quá khứ và ảnh hưởng xấu đến độ chính xác của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Khi đóng vai trò đi tìm chân lý, lịch sử còn có nhiệm vụ làm sáng tỏ những câu chuyện truyền miệng hay thần thoại đã tồn tại từ lâu nhưng thiếu bằng chứng xác thực.[13][c]

Một góc nhìn khác cho rằng giá trị cốt lõi của lịch sử nằm ở những bài học kinh nghiệm để lại cho nhân loại ngày nay. Ý tưởng ở đây là hiểu rõ quá khứ sẽ giúp con người ra quyết định tốt hơn, chẳng hạn như để tránh lặp lại sai lầm của quá khứ.[15] Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn giúp ta hiểu về bản chất con người. Trong những bối cảnh và thời đại khác nhau, con người sẽ cư xử khác đi, giống như việc người ta du lịch để học hỏi về các nền văn hóa mới vậy.[16] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò là chất keo gắn kết xã hội. Khi nhiều người có chung một quá khứ, họ hình thành một bản sắc tập thể vững chắc, nhờ đó các di sản và giá trị văn hóa được bảo tồn và lưu truyền qua nhiều thế hệ.[17] Đối với một số học giả, bao gồm giới sử gia Whig và học giả Mác-xít E. H. Carr, lịch sử là chìa khóa để am hiểu hiện tại[18] và (theo Carr) định hình tương lai.[19]

Lịch sử đôi lúc cũng được sử dụng làm công cụ chính trị và công cụ tuyên truyền, ví dụ như ca ngợi những truyền thống cũ nhằm giúp giới cầm quyền duy trì hiện trạng hoặc phơi bày những bất công trong quá khứ để thúc đẩy thay đổi.[20] Ở dạng cực đoan, người ta cố ý bỏ qua hoặc xuyên tạc bằng chứng để tạo ra những câu chuyện hoàn toàn sai lệch, dẫn đến ngụy sử hoặc xuyên tạc lịch sử.[12][d] Một số ví dụ tiêu biểu gồm phủ nhận sự tồn tại của nạn diệt chủng Holocaust, diệt chủng Armenia, thảm sát Nam Kinh và Holodomor.[22]

Từ nguyên

Mẩu sách Lịch sử của Herodotos, một văn bản lịch sử thời Hy Lạp cổ đại[23]
Từ lịch sử trong tiếng Việt là cách đọc Hán-Việt của hai chữ 歷史 (lìshǐ).[1]

Từ history trong tiếng Anh bắt nguồn từ chữ Hy Lạp cổ ἵστωρ (histōr) tức 'người có học, thông thái'. Từ này phái sinh từ Hy Lạp cổ ἱστορία (historiā), vốn mang nghĩa rộng gắn với tra vấn nói chung và đưa ra lời chứng. Thuật ngữ sau đó được chuyển tự sang tiếng Latinh cổ điển thành historia. Vào thời Hy Lạp hóa và La Mã, ý nghĩa của thuật ngữ có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào khía cạnh tường thuật và nghệ thuật trình bày thay vì nghiên cứu và lời chứng.[24]

Từ history du nhập vào tiếng Anh trung đại vào thế kỷ 14 thông qua chữ histoire của tiếng Pháp cổ.[25] Lúc bấy giờ, nó có nghĩa là 'câu chuyện, truyện kể', gồm cả tường thuật có thật và hư cấu. Vào thế kỷ 15, nghĩa của từ này thay đổi theo hướng bao hàm nhánh tri thức nghiên cứu quá khứ đi đôi với tự sự về quá khứ.[26] Đến thế kỷ 18 và 19, chữ history dần liên hệ chặt chẽ hơn với tường thuật thực tế và tra vấn dựa trên bằng chứng cùng thời điểm với giai đoạn chuyên nghiệp hóa của nghiên cứu lịch sử, một ý nghĩa hiện còn mang tính chi phối trong cách dùng từ đương đại.[27] Ý nghĩa bao hàm cả truyện kể đơn thuần và tự sự có thật về quá khứ cũng hiện diện trong thuật ngữ lịch sử ở nhiều ngôn ngữ châu Âu khác như histoire (tiếng Pháp), storia (tiếng Ý) và Geschichte (tiếng Đức).[28]

Phương pháp
Bài chi tiết: Phương pháp lịch sử
Phương pháp lịch sử là một tập hợp các kỹ thuật mà giới sử học áp dụng để nghiên cứu và lý giải quá khứ, bao gồm các quy trình thu thập, đánh giá và tổng hợp chứng cứ.[e] Phương pháp lịch sử nhằm đảm bảo tính nghiêm ngặt, chính xác và độ tin cậy học thuật về cách lựa chọn, phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng lịch sử.[30] Nghiên cứu lịch sử thường bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi nghiên cứu để xác định phạm vi đề tài. Một số câu hỏi nghiên cứu tập trung đơn thuần vào mô tả những gì đã xảy ra, trong khi số khác hướng đến giải thích lý do một sự kiện cụ thể xảy ra, bác bỏ giả thuyết đã có hoặc xác nhận một giả thuyết mới.[31]

Sử liệu và phê phán sử liệu
Để giải đáp câu hỏi nghiên cứu, các sử gia sử dụng nhiều loại bằng chứng khác nhau để tái hiện lại quá khứ và củng cố cho kết luận của mình. Bằng chứng lịch sử thường được chia thành nguồn sơ cấp và thứ cấp.[32] Nguồn sơ cấp là những thứ được hình thành ngay trong thời kỳ đó. Có nhiều loại nguồn sơ cấp như tài liệu chính thức, thư từ, nhật ký, lời kể của nhân chứng, ảnh chụp, bản ghi âm hoặc ghi hình. Tư liệu sơ cấp còn bao gồm dấu tích lịch sử được tìm thấy qua khảo cổ học, địa chất học và y khoa, ví dụ như hiện vật và hóa thạch lấy từ các cuộc khai quật. Nguồn sơ cấp cho ta bằng chứng trực tiếp nhất về các sự kiện quá khứ.[33]

Kho lưu trữ chứa lượng lớn sử liệu gốc để các nhà nghiên cứu tiếp cận.[34]
Nguồn thứ cấp là tư liệu phân tích hoặc lý giải thông tin của tư liệu khác.[35] Việc một nguồn tài liệu được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp phụ thuộc cả vào bản chất lẫn mục đích sử dụng của tư liệu đó. Chẳng hạn, tài liệu nghiên cứu về chế độ nô lệ được viết bằng cách phân tích các tài liệu lịch sử sẽ là nguồn thứ cấp khi nói về chế độ nô lệ nhưng lại là nguồn sơ cấp về quan điểm của sử gia đó.[36][f] Một trong những tiêu chuẩn phải có của một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử đáng tin cậy là tính nhất quán với các tư liệu đã có. Nếu các nhà sử học tìm thấy những nguồn tài liệu mới, họ có thể sẽ phải sửa đổi hoặc bác bỏ những câu chuyện lịch sử đã và đang được công nhận.[38] Để tìm kiếm và tiếp cận với sử liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp, các sử gia thường tra cứu kho lưu trữ, thư viện và bảo tàng. Kho lưu trữ đóng vai trò chủ chốt qua việc lưu lại và công khai vô số tư liệu nguyên bản đến giới nghiên cứu một cách có hệ thống và dễ tiếp cận. Nhờ những tiến bộ công nghệ, giới sử học đang ngày càng tận dụng nguồn tài nguyên trực tuyến với các cơ sở dữ liệu phong phú cùng những kỹ thuật tìm kiếm và truy cập tài liệu.[39]

Phê phán sử liệu là quá trình phân tích và đánh giá thông tin mà một tư liệu cung cấp.[g] Thông thường, quá trình này bắt đầu bằng phê phán ngoại tại, tức là đánh giá tính xác thực của sử liệu bằng cách đặt ra những câu hỏi như sử liệu này ra đời khi nào, ở đâu, ai là tác giả, mục đích người đó làm ra sử liệu là gì, sử liệu có từng bị chỉnh sửa gì sau thời điểm xuất bản hay không. Ngoài ra, phê phán ngoại tại còn bao gồm phân biệt giữa bản gốc, bản sao và bản làm giả.[41]

Phê phán nội tại là đánh giá nội dung của tư liệu, thường bắt đầu bằng việc làm rõ ý nghĩa những gì tư liệu muốn nói. Việc này bao gồm làm rõ nghĩa những từ ngữ có thể gây nhầm lẫn, hoặc nếu tài liệu viết bằng một ngôn ngữ lạ thì cần phải dịch nó ra.[h] Khi đã hiểu nội dung, bước quan trọng nhất là xác định tính chính xác: thông tin có đáng tin không, có bị bóp méo hay trình bày sai sự thật không, có đầy đủ không, có bỏ sót chi tiết quan trọng nào không. Một cách tiến hành những việc trên là đánh giá khả năng trình bày trung thực sự kiện được nghiên cứu của tác giả về mặt nguyên tắc. Ngoài ra, còn có một số phương pháp tiếp cận khác như đánh giá tầm ảnh hưởng của ý định hay thiên kiến từ tác giả và tham chiếu thông tin với các nguồn đáng tin cậy khác. Nhận biết về thiếu sót của sử liệu giúp các nhà sử học quyết định có nên tin tưởng sử liệu đó hay không, nếu có thì nên tin những khía cạnh gì và nên sử dụng nó như thế nào để xây dựng tường thuật.[43]

Tổng hợp lịch sử và các trường phái tư tưởng
Từ bước lựa chọn, phân tích và phê phán sử liệu, sử gia sẽ xác minh được một lượng lớn các luận điểm độc lập về quá khứ. Ở bước tiếp theo, đôi khi còn gọi là tổng hợp lịch sử, nhà sử học sẽ tìm hiểu cách thức liên kết những bằng chứng riêng lẻ đó thành một bức tranh tổng thể.[i] Việc xây dựng góc nhìn bao quát là cần thiết để có sự hiểu biết toàn diện về đề tài nghiên cứu. Đây là một khía cạnh sáng tạo[j] của ghi chép lịch sử nhằm tái hiện và lý giải những gì đã xảy ra thông qua việc xác định mối liên hệ giữa nhiều sự kiện khác nhau.[46] Nhờ đó, sử gia có thể xác định được những sự kiện nào đã diễn ra, nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng là gì.[47] Tuy không có kỹ thuật duy nhất nào được chấp nhận rộng rãi, giới sử học vẫn áp dụng nhiều công cụ và cách tiếp cận diễn giải trong quá trình trên.[48]

Auguste Comte là người phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng, ủng hộ tiếp cận lịch sử trên cơ sở khoa học.[49]
Một công cụ giúp khái quát và trình bày dễ hiểu các quá trình phát triển phức tạp là phân kỳ lịch sử, tức là chia một khoảng thời gian thành nhiều giai đoạn riêng biệt, mỗi giai đoạn được xác định bởi một chủ đề hoặc quá trình phát triển chủ đạo. Ví dụ, hệ thống ba thời đại thường được sử dụng để phân chia lịch sử loài người thuở đầu thành thời đại đồ đá, thời đại đồ đồng và thời đại đồ sắt dựa trên loại nguyên vật liệu và công nghệ chủ yếu đặc trưng cho từng thời kỳ.[50] Một phương pháp khác là nghiên cứu khoảng trống trong ghi chép lịch sử, tức những sự kiện đã từng xảy ra nhưng không để lại bằng chứng đáng kể nào. Những khoảng trống này có thể xuất hiện khi người đương thời cho rằng thông tin quá hiển nhiên nên không cần ghi lại, hoặc khi thông tin bị cố ý giấu giếm hay tiêu hủy.[51][k] Ngược lại, khi có sẵn các tập dữ liệu lớn thì sử gia có thể sử dụng hướng tiếp cận định lượng. Chẳng hạn, các nhà sử học kinh tế và xã hội thường áp dụng phương pháp phân tích thống kê để nhận diện quy luật và xu hướng trong phạm vi tập thể rộng lớn.[54]

Mỗi trường phái tư tưởng có quan điểm riêng về mặt phương pháp luận trong ghi chép lịch sử.[55] Những nhà sử học theo chủ nghĩa thực chứng xem nghiên cứu lịch sử là một hoạt động mang tính khoa học và cho rằng bằng chứng thực nghiệm đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tìm kiếm chân lý khách quan.[56] Trái lại, các nhà hậu hiện đại phủ nhận tính hợp lệ của những đại tự sự vốn được cho là mang lại một chân lý khách quan duy nhất. Chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại thay vào đó đề cao bản chất chủ quan của lý giải lịch sử và xem đây là nền tảng cho sự đa dạng của các quan điểm lịch sử khác nhau.[57] Những nhà Mác-xít cho rằng mọi sự phát triển lịch sử đều bắt nguồn từ động lực kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp.[58] Trường phái Annales tập trung nghiên cứu các xu hướng kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn, lấy những phương pháp định lượng và tiếp cận liên ngành làm trọng tâm.[59] Sử học nữ quyền nghiên cứu vai trò của giới tính xã hội trong lịch sử, đặc biệt quan tâm đến việc phân tích kinh nghiệm của phụ nữ và phê phán các quan niệm mang tính phụ quyền trong chép sử truyền thống.[60]

Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu
Lịch sử là một lĩnh vực nghiên cứu rộng bao gồm nhiều phân nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào một giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể còn số khác tập trung vào một khu vực địa lý hoặc đề tài nhất định. Một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử thường có thể có sự kết hợp nhiều hướng chuyên môn khác nhau; chẳng hạn, một tác phẩm về lịch sử kinh tế ở Ai Cập cổ đại có sự tổng hợp các góc nhìn về mặt thời gian, không gian và chủ đề. Đối với đề tài phạm vi rộng, lượng sử liệu sơ cấp liên quan thường quá lớn để có thể khảo cứu hết, buộc sử gia phải thu hẹp tầm vực chủ đề nghiên cứu hoặc sử dụng thêm tài liệu thứ cấp để đi đến kết luận tổng quan.[61]

Theo giai đoạn
Phân chia theo trình tự thời gian là một cách tiếp cận thường gặp để sắp xếp tiến trình lịch sử rộng lớn thành nhiều phân đoạn. Việc xác định các thời kỳ thường dựa trên những đặc trưng nổi bật của một giai đoạn nhất định cùng với các sự kiện quan trọng đánh dấu sự khởi đầu hoặc kết thúc những bước phát triển đó. Tùy vào bối cảnh nghiên cứu và mức độ chi tiết mà một thời kỳ có thể kéo dài từ vài thập kỷ đến hàng thế kỷ.[62] Một hướng tiếp cận tiêu biểu là chia lịch sử thế giới thành thời tiền sử, thời kỳ cổ đại, thời kỳ trung đại, thời kỳ cận đại và thời kỳ hiện đại.[63][l] Tuy nhiên, tùy theo khu vực và chủ đề nghiên cứu mà có thể có sự khác biệt về ranh giới thời gian giữa các thời kỳ trên và giới sử học cũng có thể sử dụng cách phân kỳ hoàn toàn khác.[65] Chẳng hạn, lịch sử Trung Quốc thường được phân kỳ theo các triều đại chính,[66] trong khi lịch sử châu Mỹ lại thường được chia theo các giai đoạn tiền Colombo, thực dân và hậu thực dân.[67]

Các nhà sử học sử dụng bằng chứng từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau để nghiên cứu thời tiền sử, bao gồm cả hóa thạch như Lucy.[68]
Nghiên cứu thời tiền sử bao gồm khảo sát quá trình tiến hóa của các loài người cổ cách đây vài triệu năm, dẫn đến sự xuất hiện của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu khoảng 200.000 năm trước.[69] Thời gian sau đó, loài người dần di cư khỏi châu Phi để cư trú ở hầu khắp Trái Đất. Về cuối thời tiền sử, những tiến bộ về công nghệ (nhất là trong chế tác công cụ) đã khiến nhiều cộng đồng người từ bỏ lối sống du mục quen thuộc dựa vào săn bắt và hái lượm và chuyển sang lối sống ít vận động dựa trên những hoạt động nông nghiệp sơ khai.[70] Sự thiếu vắng tài liệu thành văn từ thời kỳ này để lại nhiều thách thức đối với các nhà nghiên cứu và là nền tảng để cho ra đời một phương pháp tiếp cận liên ngành trên cơ sở tổng hợp những dạng bằng chứng khác từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, nhân loại học, cổ sinh vật học và địa chất học.[71]

Giới sử gia nghiên cứu thời cổ đại khảo sát sự hình thành các nền văn minh lớn đầu tiên ở những khu vực như Lưỡng Hà, Ai Cập, lưu vực sông Ấn, Trung Quốc và Peru, bắt đầu từ khoảng năm 3500 TCN tại một số nơi. Những biến đổi phức tạp trong xã hội, kinh tế và chính trị đã tạo điều kiện cho việc phát triển các hệ thống chữ viết đầu tiên. Nhờ những thành tựu mới về nông nghiệp, lượng lương thực thặng dư đã giúp các nền văn minh trên nuôi sống được quy mô dân số ngày càng lớn, kéo theo quá trình đô thị hóa, sự thành lập nhiều mạng lưới thương mại và sự xuất hiện những đế chế khu vực. Ở giai đoạn sau của thời cổ đại, đôi khi còn gọi là thời kỳ cổ điển, các xã hội tại Trung Quốc, Ấn Độ, Ba Tư và Địa Trung Hải tiếp tục mở rộng và đạt đến đỉnh cao mới về văn hóa, khoa học và chính trị. Cùng lúc đó, nhiều hệ thống tôn giáo và tư tưởng triết học lớn như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Do Thái giáo và triết học Hy Lạp cũng được hình thành tại đây.[72]

Trong nghiên cứu về thời kỳ trung đại (bắt đầu vào khoảng năm 500 CN), giới sử học đề cập đến tầm ảnh hưởng ngày càng sâu rộng của những tôn giáo lớn. Các tôn giáo truyền đạo như Phật giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo lan tỏa nhanh chóng và trở thành tôn giáo thế giới, đánh dấu bước chuyển dịch lớn về văn hóa khi dần thay thế nhiều hệ tín ngưỡng khác. Cùng thời điểm, các mạng lưới thương mại liên khu vực phát triển mạnh mẽ, thúc đẩy sự giao lưu về công nghệ và văn hóa. Vào thế kỷ 13 và 14, đế quốc Mông Cổ xâm lược nhiều vùng lãnh thổ ở châu Á và châu Âu và trở thành thế lực thống trị hàng đầu.[73]

Các sử gia chuyên nghiên cứu thời cận đại (bắt đầu khoảng năm 1500 CN) thường tập trung phân tích quá trình trỗi dậy và thâu tóm quyền lực toàn cầu của các nước châu Âu. Những nước đế quốc thuốc súng này đã tiến hành khai phá và thực dân hóa nhiều khu vực rộng lớn trên thế giới. Hệ quả là châu Mỹ được kết nối vào mạng lưới toàn cầu, khởi đầu cho một cuộc trao đổi sinh học quy mô lớn với sự di chuyển của cả thực vật, động vật, con người và mầm bệnh.[m] Cách mạng khoa học là xúc tác cho các phát kiến lớn và tăng tốc tiến bộ công nghệ, song song với đó là nhiều bước tiến khác về tri thức như chủ nghĩa nhân văn và thời kỳ Khai Sáng, mở đường cho tiến trình thế tục hóa.[75]

Cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp có tác động sâu rộng đến đời sống kinh tế và xã hội, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ xã hội nông nghiệp sang xã hội công nghiệp.[76]
Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử hiện đại (bắt đầu vào cuối thế kỷ 18), giới sử học quan tâm đến cách mà cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp làm chuyển dịch các nền kinh tế nhờ việc cho ra đời những phương thức sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Các cường quốc phương Tây thành lập những đế chế thực dân rộng lớn và củng cố ưu thế nhờ công nghệ quân sự công nghiệp hóa. Sự gia tăng trao đổi hàng hóa, tư tưởng và con người đánh dấu bước đầu của quá trình toàn cầu hóa. Hàng loạt cuộc cách mạng xã hội bùng nổ chống lại các chế độ chuyên quyền và thực dân, đặt nền móng cho những thể chế dân chủ. Nhiều lĩnh vực như khoa học, công nghệ, kinh tế, mức sống và dân số tăng trưởng với tốc độ chưa từng có bất chấp tàn phá nặng nề từ hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới, vốn đã làm thay đổi căn bản cán cân quyền lực quốc tế với sự suy yếu vai trò thống trị của châu Âu.[77]

Theo vị trí địa lý
Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng có thể được phân loại theo vị trí địa lý.[78] Yếu tố địa lý đóng vai trò quan trọng trong lịch sử do có ảnh hưởng đến sản xuất thực phẩm, tài nguyên thiên nhiên, hoạt động kinh tế, ranh giới chính trị và giao lưu văn hóa.[79][n] Một số tác phẩm lịch sử có phạm vi nghiên cứu chỉ ở những khu vực nhỏ như làng xã hay khu định cư, còn số khác tập trung vào các vùng lãnh thổ rộng lớn trải khắp toàn bộ châu lục, ví dụ như lịch sử châu Phi, châu Á, châu Âu, châu Mỹ và châu Đại Dương.[81]

Quần thể kim tự tháp Giza đại diện cho di sản lâu đời của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại.[82]
Lịch sử châu Phi khởi đầu với nghiên cứu về sự tiến hóa của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu.[83] Các nhà sử học cổ đại mô tả quá trình phát minh chữ viết và cái nôi của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại vào thiên niên kỷ 4 TCN.[84] Trong thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, nhiều nền văn minh và vương quốc tiêu biểu khác được hình thành tại Nubia, Axum, Carthage, Ghana, Mali và Songhay.[85] Hồi giáo bắt đầu lan truyền khắp Bắc Phi vào thế kỷ 7 CN và trở thành đức tin lớn nhất ở nhiều đế quốc. Trong khi đó, hoạt động thương mại dọc theo tuyến xuyên Sahara phát triển mạnh.[86] Từ thế kỷ 15, hàng triệu người châu Phi bị bắt làm nô lệ và đưa sang châu Mỹ trong khuôn khổ cuộc buôn bán nô lệ Đại Tây Dương.[87] Phần lớn châu lục rơi vào ách đô hộ của các cường quốc châu Âu vào cuối thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20.[88] Trước làn sóng chủ nghĩa dân tộc, các nước châu Phi dần giành lại độc lập trong giai đoạn sau Thế chiến II, một thời kỳ chứng kiến tiến bộ kinh tế, tăng trưởng nhanh về dân số và đấu tranh vì ổn định chính trị.[89]

Giới sử học nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Á nhận thấy người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 100.000 năm trước.[90] Châu Á được xem là một trong những cái nôi của nền văn minh nhân loại với sự ra đời một số nền văn minh cổ đại đầu tiên ở Lưỡng Hà, lưu vực sông Ấn và Trung Quốc bắt đầu từ thiên niên kỷ thứ 4 và thứ 3 TCN.[91] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, các nền văn minh ở châu Á lục địa sản sinh ra tất cả các tôn giáo thế giới lớn và một số truyền thống triết học tiêu biểu như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Đạo giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo.[92] Khoảng thời gian này còn chứng kiến việc con đường tơ lụa được thành lập nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại và trao đổi văn hóa trên khắp lục địa Á-Âu, cùng với đó là sự hình thành các đế chế hùng mạnh như đế quốc Mông Cổ.[93] Ảnh hưởng của châu Âu dần gia tăng trong những thế kỷ tiếp theo, mở ra thời kỳ hiện đại, và đạt đỉnh vào thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20 khi nhiều khu vực của châu Á rơi vào ách cai trị thực dân đến khi Thế chiến II kết thúc.[94] Sau khi giành lại độc lập, các quốc gia châu Á bước vào giai đoạn hiện đại hóa với nền kinh tế và quy mô dân số tăng trưởng nhanh.[95]

Do tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến văn hóa và triết học phương Tây, Hy Lạp cổ đại là một đối tượng nghiên cứu quan trọng đối với các nhà sử học châu Âu.[96]
Trong nghiên cứu lịch sử châu Âu, các sử gia mô tả sự xuất hiện của những người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đầu tiên cách đây khoảng 45.000 năm.[97] Nhiều công trình nghiên cứu tập trung tìm hiểu những đóng góp quan trọng từ Hy Lạp cổ đại cho văn hóa, triết học và chính trị gắn liền với thế giới phương Tây vào thiên niên kỷ thứ nhất TCN,[96] cũng như cảm hứng từ di sản văn hóa của nền văn minh này đối với đế quốc La Mã và Đông La Mã.[98] Thời kỳ trung đại bắt đầu với việc đế quốc Tây La Mã sụp đổ vào thế kỷ 5 CN và được đánh dấu bởi làn sóng lan truyền Kitô giáo.[99] Từ thế kỷ 15, công cuộc khai phá và thuộc địa hóa từ châu Âu đã làm kết nối các châu lục lại với nhau, trong khi những bước tiến văn hóa, tri thức và khoa học thúc đẩy sự thay đổi của nhiều xã hội phương Tây.[100] Từ cuối thế kỷ 18 đến đầu thế kỷ 20, thế thống trị toàn cầu của châu Âu được củng cố bởi cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp và sự thành lập các thuộc địa lớn.[101] Thế thống trị đó chấm dứt do hậu quả thảm khốc của hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới.[102] Đến thời Chiến tranh Lạnh, châu lục bị chia cắt thành một khối phía Tây và một khối phía Đông. Cả hai khối cùng thúc đẩy hợp tác chính trị và kinh tế sâu rộng hơn sau khi Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc.[103]

Giới sử học khảo sát lịch sử châu Mỹ ghi nhận sự hiện diện những con người đầu tiên vào khoảng 20.000 đến 15.000 năm trước.[104] Châu Mỹ là cái nôi của vài trong số các nền văn minh sớm nhất như văn minh Norte Chico ở Nam Mỹ và văn minh Maya và Olmec ở Trung Mỹ.[105] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo chứng kiến sự xuất hiện nhiều đế chế lớn như Teotihuacan, Aztec và đế quốc Inca.[106] Sau khi người châu Âu gia nhập lục địa từ cuối thế kỷ 15, nhiều căn bệnh truyền nhiễm mới lan rộng dẫn đến dân số sụt giảm nghiêm trọng. Việc này cùng với quá trình thực dân hóa đã khiến các đế chế lớn sụp đổ và làm cấu trúc nhân khẩu học cũng như diện mạo văn hóa thay đổi toàn diện.[107] Các phong trào độc lập vào thế kỷ 18 và 19 dẫn đến việc hình thành những quốc gia mới trên khắp châu Mỹ.[108] Đến thế kỷ 20, Mỹ vươn lên trở thành cường quốc toàn cầu và đóng vai trò nổi bật trong cục diện Chiến tranh Lạnh.[109]

Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Đại Dương, các sử gia nhận định con người đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 60.000 đến 50.000 năm trước.[110] Quá trình phát triển các xã hội và nền văn hóa khu vực đa dạng được ghi nhận đầu tiên ở Úc và Papua New Guinea, sau mới đến các đảo khác thuộc Thái Bình Dương.[111] Sự gia nhập của người châu Âu vào thế kỷ 16 mang đến nhiều biến đổi sâu sắc, và đến cuối thế kỷ 19 phần lớn khu vực đã bị các nước phương Tây kiểm soát.[112] Châu Đại Dương đã tham gia nhiều cuộc xung đột trong hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới và trải qua giai đoạn phi thực dân hóa trong thời hậu chiến.[113]

Theo đề tài
Giới sử học thường giới hạn phạm vi khảo cứu về một chủ đề cụ thể.[114] Một số học giả đề xuất phân chia tổng quát thành ba đề tài chính: lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử kinh tế và lịch sử xã hội. Tuy nhiên, ranh giới giữa các phân nhánh này là mơ hồ và quan hệ giữa chúng với các phân nhánh đề tài khác như lịch sử trí thức không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng.[115]

Lịch sử chính trị nghiên cứu tổ chức quyền lực trong xã hội, tìm hiểu cách thức ra đời, phát triển và tác động qua lại của các cấu trúc quyền lực. Nhà nước hoặc các cấu trúc tương tự nhà nước là đối tượng trọng tâm của lĩnh vực nghiên cứu này xuyên suốt phần lớn lịch sử được ghi chép. Lịch sử chính trị phân tích cơ chế tổ chức nội bộ của một quốc gia, ví dụ như bè phái, đảng phái, tầng lớp lãnh đạo và các thể chế chính trị khác. Phân nhánh này còn nghiên cứu về việc hoạch định và thực thi chính sách cũng như quan hệ giữa nhà nước với các quốc gia khác.[116] Lịch sử chính trị là một trong những phân nhánh lâu đời nhất của lịch sử do đã được các sử gia như Herodotos và Thucydides nghiên cứu từ thời cổ đại, trong khi các lĩnh vực con tiêu biểu khác chỉ mới được công nhận là phân nhánh độc lập vào thế kỷ trước.[117]

Ảnh chụp một máy bắn đá thời trung cổ được phục dựng trên một bệ đá với nền trời nhiều mây ở phía sau
Lịch sử quân sự nghiên cứu về xung đột vũ trang, bao gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ quân sự như máy bắn đá.[118]
Lịch sử ngoại giao và lịch sử quân sự có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử chính trị. Lịch sử ngoại giao khảo sát quan hệ quốc tế giữa các quốc gia, bao gồm những vấn đề liên quan đến chính sách đối ngoại như đàm phán, toan tính chiến lược, hiệp ước và xung đột giữa các nước cũng như vai trò của các tổ chức quốc tế trong những quy trình này.[119] Lịch sử quân sự phân tích sự hình thành, phát triển và tác động của các cuộc xung đột vũ trang trong lịch sử thế giới. Phạm vi nghiên cứu của lịch sử quân sự bao gồm phân tích về các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như tìm hiểu một trận chiến hay nguyên nhân gây ra một cuộc chiến tranh. Lịch sử quân sự còn xem xét tổng quan về sự phát triển của chiến tranh, trong đó gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ, chiến lược, chiến thuật, hậu cần và thể chế quân sự.[120]

Lịch sử kinh tế nghiên cứu cách thức sản xuất, trao đổi và tiêu thụ hàng hóa. Lĩnh vực này bao quát những khía cạnh kinh tế như sử dụng đất, lao động và tư bản, cung và cầu hàng hóa, chi phí và tư liệu sản xuất, phân phối thu nhập và của cải. Các nhà sử học kinh tế thường chú trọng phân tích những xu hướng chung mang tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như lạm phát, hơn là hành động và quyết định của cá nhân. Nếu có đủ dữ liệu, họ thường sử dụng các phương pháp định lượng như phân tích thống kê. Ở những giai đoạn trước thời kỳ hiện đại, dữ liệu có sẵn thường bị hạn chế, buộc giới sử học kinh tế phải phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tài liệu khan hiếm và ngoại suy thông tin từ chúng.[121]

Lịch sử xã hội là một lĩnh vực rộng lớn chuyên nghiên cứu những hiện tượng xã hội, song định nghĩa chính xác của nó chưa có sự thống nhất. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem đây là ngành nghiên cứu về cuộc sống thường ngày ngoài phạm vi chính trị và kinh tế, bao gồm tập quán văn hóa, cấu trúc gia đình, quan hệ cộng đồng và giáo dục. Một hướng tiếp cận mật thiết chú trọng nhiều hơn vào khám phá kinh nghiệm từ các nhóm xã hội cụ thể như giai cấp, chủng tộc, giới tính hoặc nhóm tuổi đối với thế giới mình đang sinh sống. Các cách hiểu khác coi lịch sử xã hội là nghiên cứu về những vấn đề xã hội như đói nghèo, bệnh tật và tội phạm, hoặc mở rộng phạm vi để xem xét sự phát triển của toàn thể xã hội nói chung.[122] Một số lĩnh vực có liên hệ gần gũi với lịch sử xã hội bao gồm lịch sử văn hóa, lịch sử giới tính và lịch sử tôn giáo.[123]

Lịch sử trí thức là lịch sử về tư tưởng, chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình phát triển của các khái niệm, triết lý và ý thức hệ. Nhánh này đặc biệt quan tâm đến các lĩnh vực học thuật nhưng mặt khác còn bao gồm nghiên cứu về tín ngưỡng và định kiến trong đời sống của con người bình thường. Bên cạnh việc tìm hiểu các phong trào trí thức, lịch sử trí thức còn khảo sát bối cảnh văn hóa và xã hội đã góp phần định hình nên những phong trào đó cũng như ảnh hưởng từ chúng đối với các tiến trình lịch sử khác.[124] Là hai trong những lĩnh vực liên quan mật thiết, lịch sử triết học phân tích sự phát triển của tư tưởng triết lý[125] còn lịch sử khoa học nghiên cứu quá trình biến đổi của lý thuyết và thực tiễn khoa học, chẳng hạn như những đóng góp khoa học của Charles Darwin và Albert Einstein.[126] Lịch sử học nghệ thuật là một bộ môn khác có liên hệ với lịch sử trí thức, chuyên suy xét các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trong lịch sử cùng với sự phát triển của các hình thức, phong cách và trào lưu nghệ thuật. Lịch sử học nghệ thuật bao gồm bàn luận về bối cảnh văn hóa, xã hội và chính trị của sáng tạo nghệ thuật.[127]

Lịch sử môi trường nghiên cứu quan hệ giữa con người và môi trường sống, hướng đến am hiểu cách mà loài người và phần còn lại của tự nhiên tác động lẫn nhau trong chiều dài lịch sử.[128] Một số phân nhánh khác theo đề tài bao gồm lịch sử hiến pháp, lịch sử luật pháp, lịch sử đô thị, lịch sử kinh doanh, lịch sử công nghệ, lịch sử y học, lịch sử giáo dục và lịch sử dân tộc.[129]

Lĩnh vực khác
Một số phân nhánh của lịch sử được đặc trưng bởi phương pháp mà chúng áp dụng. Chẳng hạn, lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử phụ thuộc lần lượt vào các phương pháp định lượng và phương tiện truyền thông kỹ thuật số trong nghiên cứu.[130] Lịch sử so sánh đối chiếu các hiện tượng lịch sử thuộc những thời kỳ, khu vực hoặc nền văn hóa phân biệt để xem xét những điểm giống và khác nhau giữa chúng.[131] Không giống như hầu hết phân nhánh khác, lịch sử truyền miệng dựa vào lời kể thay vì tài liệu ghi chép, bao hàm tường thuật nhân chứng, chứng cứ nghe nói lại và truyền thuyết cộng đồng. Lịch sử truyền miệng phản ánh kinh nghiệm cá nhân, sự diễn giải và trí nhớ của những người dân thường, cho thấy tính chủ quan trong cách con người ghi nhớ lịch sử.[132] Lịch sử phản thực tế sử dụng tư duy phản thực tế để khảo sát những hướng đi khác của lịch sử và khám phá những gì có thể sẽ xảy ra dưới những điều kiện khác nhau.[133] Một vài phân nhánh nhất định của lịch sử được tách bạch dựa trên quan điểm lý thuyết, ví dụ như lịch sử Mác-xít và lịch sử nữ quyền.[134]

Lịch sử thế giới nghiên cứu lịch sử ở cấp độ toàn cầu, kết hợp với toàn bộ lịch sử loài người.[135]
Một số cách phân chia lĩnh vực tập trung vào tầm vực của đề tài nghiên cứu. Lịch sử Vĩ đại là nhánh có tầm vực rộng nhất, bao hàm mọi thứ từ Vụ Nổ Lớn cho đến hiện tại, kết hợp các yếu tố của vũ trụ học, địa chất học, sinh học và nhân loại học.[9] Lịch sử thế giới là một phân nhánh khác với phạm vi rộng, khảo sát toàn thể lịch sử loài người bắt đầu từ sự tiến hóa của các loài giống người.[135] Các thuật ngữ lịch sử vĩ mô hay lịch sử vi mô chỉ những cấp độ quy mô phân tích khác nhau, dao động từ các quy luật mang tính toàn cầu đến nghiên cứu chi tiết về bối cảnh địa phương, cộng đồng nhỏ, gia đình, cá nhân hoặc sự kiện cụ thể.[136] Có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử vi mô là thể loại tiểu sử lịch sử, chuyên thuật lại cuộc đời của một cá nhân trong bối cảnh thời đại và di sản mà nhân vật để lại.[137]

Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm các hoạt động nhằm trình bày lịch sử đến công chúng. Việc này thường diễn ra bên ngoài phạm vi học thuật truyền thống ở những bối cảnh như bảo tàng, di tích lịch sử, du lịch di sản và truyền thông đại chúng.[138]

Quá trình phát triển của bộ môn
Trước khi có chữ viết, tri thức lịch sử được lưu truyền chủ yếu qua truyền miệng.[139] Những bản ghi chép lịch sử sớm nhất thường đan xen giữa các sự kiện có thật với yếu tố thần thoại, chẳng hạn như Sử thi Gilgamesh từ Lưỡng Hà cổ đại và Odyssey, một tác phẩm của Hy Lạp cổ đại được cho là do Homeros sáng tác.[140] Xuất bản vào thế kỷ 5 TCN, cuốn Lịch sử của Herodotos[o] là một trong những công trình nền tảng của truyền thống sử học phương Tây, trong đó tác giả chú trọng vào khảo cứu dựa trên lý tính và bằng chứng thay vì những câu chuyện của Homeros và các thi sĩ khác.[142] Thucydides kế thừa và phát triển phương pháp của Herodotos nhưng tập trung nhiều hơn vào các tiến trình phát triển chính trị và quân sự cụ thể, trái ngược với phạm vi rộng cùng các yếu tố dân tộc chí trong tác phẩm của Herodotos.[143] Sử luận La Mã chịu ảnh hưởng lớn từ truyền thống Hy Lạp, kết hợp giữa việc ghi chép sự kiện và phán xét đạo đức về các nhân vật lịch sử.[p] Các sử gia La Mã thời kỳ đầu sử dụng phong cách biên niên sử, sắp xếp các sự kiện theo từng năm và hầu như không bình luận gì thêm, còn những tác giả về sau ưu tiên nhiều hơn vào tường thuật và phân tích.[145]

Sử ký của Tư Mã Thiên là một trong những tự sự lịch sử công phu ra đời sớm nhất về lịch sử Trung Quốc và thế giới theo hiểu biết của người Trung Hoa.[146]
Một truyền thống chép sử lớn khác ra đời tại Trung Quốc cổ đại với các tiền thân đầu tiên xuất hiện vào cuối thiên niên kỷ thứ 2 TCN. Truyền thống đó xem biên niên sử là hình thái cao nhất của ghi chép lịch sử và đề cao việc kiểm chứng dựa trên sử liệu. Tập quán này gắn liền với triết lý Nho gia và có liên hệ chặt chẽ với bộ máy chính quyền dưới hình thức triều đại cầm quyền. Các sử gia Trung Hoa đã phát triển một phương pháp chép sử mạch lạc và có hệ thống sớm hơn so với những nơi khác.[147] Công trình của Tư Mã Thiên có ảnh hưởng đặc biệt; phương pháp nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ cùng việc thêm thắt những quan điểm khác với chính thống từ ông đã định hình nên hệ tiêu chuẩn cho sử luận về sau.[148] Ở Ấn Độ cổ đại, tự sự lịch sử có sự gắn bó mật thiết với tôn giáo. Chúng thường kết hợp sự kiện có thật với các yếu tố siêu nhiên, điển hình như trong Mahabharata.[149]

Tại châu Âu thời trung đại, lịch sử chủ yếu được giáo sĩ ghi lại dưới hình thức biên niên sử. Giới sử gia Kitô giáo lấy truyền thống Hy-La và Do Thái làm cảm hứng để tường thuật lại quá khứ như một phần trong kế hoạch thiêng liêng do Chúa định sẵn.[150] Những nhân vật tiêu biểu góp phần làm nên tập quán này gồm sử gia Eusebius và Bêđa cùng nhà thần học Augustinô thành Hippo.[151] Ở thế giới Hồi giáo, chép sử cũng chịu ảnh hưởng tương tự từ tôn giáo, lấy góc nhìn Hồi giáo để diễn giải quá khứ. Sử luận Hồi giáo nhấn mạnh vào chuỗi truyền tin để bảo đảm độ tin cậy của tự sự lịch sử.[152] Al-Tabari là tác giả của một bộ sử ký công phu, kéo dài từ thuở khai thiên lập địa đến thời đại đương thời với ông. Ibn Khaldun phản tư các vấn đề nền tảng của chép sử về mặt triết lý, ví dụ như những quy luật phổ quát chi phối các tiến trình lịch sử cũng như giới hạn của chân lý lịch sử.[153]

Vào thời nhà Đường (618–907 CN) tại Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử ngày càng được thể chế hóa sâu hơn khi một cơ quan chuyên trách được thành lập năm 629 CN. Cơ quan này đã giám sát công tác biên soạn thực lục, những bộ ghi chép chi tiết làm nền tảng cho bộ chính sử quốc gia. Giới sử gia nhà Đường đề cao sự khác biệt giữa bản thân các sự kiện đã xảy ra và cách mà chúng được phản ánh trong các văn bản lịch sử.[154] Chép sử thời nhà Tống (960–1279 CN) diễn ra qua nhiều thể loại như bách khoa thư, tiểu sử và tiểu thuyết lịch sử, đồng thời lịch sử cũng trở thành một môn học chính trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc.[155] Tại Nhật Bản, một truyền thống chép sử riêng bắt đầu hình thành vào thế kỷ 8 CN, chịu ảnh hưởng từ mô hình Trung Hoa. Tương tự như ở Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử tại đây gắn bó mật thiết với hoàng thất nhưng các nhà sử học Nhật Bản ít chú trọng hơn vào đánh giá phê phán sử liệu.[156]

Đến thời Phục Hưng và cận đại (khoảng năm 1500 đến 1800), các truyền thống sử học dần trở nên gắn kết và ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau.[157] Từ thế kỷ 14 ở châu Âu, phong trào Phục Hưng đã đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ quan điểm tôn giáo đặc trưng của thời Trung Cổ sang mối quan tâm mới đối với di sản cổ điển Hy Lạp và La Mã. Các nhà nhân văn Phục Hưng sử dụng phương pháp phê phán sử liệu tinh vi nhằm xem xét lại những tác phẩm sử ký tôn giáo trước đây, qua đó góp phần thúc đẩy quá trình thế tục hóa trong ghi chép lịch sử. Từ thế kỷ 15 đến 17, giới sử học nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào vai trò mô phạm của lịch sử và sử dụng lịch sử như một công cụ để củng cố trật tự xã hội hiện có hoặc phục hồi lý tưởng về quá khứ. Khi máy in ép được phát minh, tài liệu viết trở nên dễ tiếp cận với chi phí phải chăng và việc tiếp nhận tri thức lịch sử dần được mở rộng ra bên ngoài giới giáo sĩ và quý tộc. Cùng lúc đó, tư tưởng hướng kinh nghiệm gắn với cuộc cách mạng khoa học đã làm dấy lên hoài nghi về khả năng đạt tới chân lý lịch sử phổ quát.[158] Trong thời kỳ Khai Sáng vào thế kỷ 18, ghi chép lịch sử chịu tác động mạnh mẽ từ chủ nghĩa duy lý và chủ nghĩa hoài nghi. Thời gian này, các nhà sử học tìm cách khai phá những quy luật và ý nghĩa sâu xa trong tiến trình lịch sử với mục đích thách thức quyền lực và giáo điều truyền thống bằng lý trí và phương pháp thực nghiệm. Ngoài ra, phạm vi của nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng được mở rộng thêm và tập trung ngày càng nhiều vào các đề tài xã hội và kinh tế cũng như so sánh các nền văn hóa khác nhau.[159]

Ở Trung Quốc thời nhà Minh (1368–1644), sự quan tâm của công chúng đối với các ấn phẩm ghi chép lịch sử gia tăng rõ rệt. Bên cạnh những công trình do sử quan biên soạn để tiếp nối thực lục của các triều đại trước, nhiều tác phẩm phi chính thức của các học giả tư nhân cũng phát triển mạnh. Những học giả này thường thể hiện phong cách sáng tạo hơn và đôi khi đưa ra diễn giải và tường thuật khác với chính thống.[160] Tại thế giới Hồi giáo, nhiều tập quán chép sử mới ra đời tại đế quốc Safavid, Mogul và Ottoman.[161] Trong khi đó tại châu Mỹ, các nhà thám hiểm châu Âu bắt đầu ghi lại và lý giải những tường thuật lịch sử của các dân tộc bản địa. Những câu chuyện này vốn được lưu truyền qua hình thức truyền miệng hoặc ký hiệu tượng hình và thường mang đến cách nhìn khác biệt so với quan điểm lịch sử của châu Âu đương thời.[162]

Leopold von Ranke đã cách mạng hóa tiêu chuẩn học thuật lịch sử nhờ cho ra đời quy trình đánh giá sử liệu sơ cấp kỹ lưỡng.[163]
Ghi chép lịch sử có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng chuyên nghiệp hóa và khoa học hóa vào thế kỷ 19. Sau công trình của Leopold von Ranke, một phương pháp phê phán sử liệu có hệ thống được thừa nhận rộng rãi và nhiều cơ sở học thuật chuyên về lịch sử như khoa ngành đại học, hiệp hội chuyên môn và tạp chí được thành lập.[164] Cùng với tinh thần khoa học của thời đại, Auguste Comte phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng và đặt ra mục tiêu khám phá những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử tương tự như với các định luật trong tự nhiên.[165] Dựa trên triết lý của Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx đã đề xuất một quy luật chung như vậy trong lý thuyết về chủ nghĩa duy vật lịch sử, cho rằng lực lượng kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp là nguyên nhân cơ bản dẫn đến thay đổi lịch sử.[166] Một bước phát triển quan trọng khác trong giai đoạn này là sự lan tỏa của các phương pháp sử luận châu Âu, vốn dần trở thành hướng tiếp cận chủ đạo trong nghiên cứu học thuật về quá khứ trên thế giới.[167]

Trong thế kỷ 20, những giả định và phương pháp lịch sử truyền thống dần bị đặt nghi vấn, còn tầm vực của nghiên cứu lịch sử tiếp tục được mở rộng.[168] Trường phái Annales kết hợp tri thức về xã hội học, tâm lý học và kinh tế học để nghiên cứu các tiến trình dài hạn.[169] Các chế độ chuyên chế như Đức Quốc Xã, Liên Xô và Trung Quốc thao túng tự sự lịch sử vì mục đích ý thức hệ.[170] Nhiều sử gia lựa chọn nghiên cứu với góc nhìn độc đáo, tập trung vào kinh nghiệm của các nhóm thiểu số xã hội qua những hướng tiếp cận như lịch sử từ dưới lên, lịch sử vi mô, lịch sử truyền miệng và sử học nữ quyền.[171] Chủ nghĩa hậu thực dân tìm cách phê phán và làm suy yếu sự bá chủ của cách tiếp cận phương Tây, còn chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại bác bỏ luận điểm về sự tồn tại một chân lý lịch sử phổ quát duy nhất.[172] Giới sử học trí thức khảo sát quá trình phát triển của các hệ tư tưởng trong lịch sử.[173] Đến nửa sau của thế kỷ, những nỗ lực mới trong biên soạn lịch sử thế giới với quy mô toàn cầu đã thu hút nhiều sự chú ý, trong khi các thành tựu công nghệ trở thành động lực cho sự phát triển của lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử.[174]

Các lĩnh vực liên quan
Sử luận
Bài chi tiết: Sử luận

Ibn Khaldun là một nhân vật tiêu biểu trong sử luận Hồi giáo.[175]
Sử luận là nghiên cứu về các phương pháp và sự phát triển của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Nhà sử luận suy xét cách thức mà sử gia tiến hành nghiên cứu và viết sử, dẫn đến đây là một siêu lý thuyết dưới dạng lịch sử của lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ sử luận theo nghĩa khác để chỉ tường thuật được ghi chép về quá khứ.[176]

Một chủ đề cốt lõi trong sử luận dưới góc độ siêu lý thuyết tập trung vào chuẩn mực của bằng chứng và luận cứ trong khảo cứu lịch sử. Giới sử luận nghiên cứu và hệ thống hóa cách thức sử gia sử dụng tư liệu để xây dựng nên tự sự về quá khứ, trong đó có việc phân tích những giả thiết lý giải làm cơ sở cho quá trình xây dựng tự sự. Một số vấn đề khác có liên quan bao gồm văn phong và thủ pháp tu từ được trình bày trong các tác phẩm lịch sử.[177]

Qua việc so sánh công trình của các sử gia, giới sử luận có thể xác định trường phái tư tưởng dựa trên phương pháp nghiên cứu, giả định và phong cách chung.[178] Chẳng hạn, nhà sử luận khảo sát đặc trưng của trường phái Annales như việc sử dụng dữ liệu định lượng từ nhiều bộ môn hay mối quan tâm chủ yếu đến các quá trình kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn.[179] Sự so sánh còn mở rộng cho toàn thể thời kỳ từ cổ đại đến hiện đại. Bằng cách này, nhà sử luận có thể vạch ra tiến trình phát triển của lịch sử với tư cách một môn học thuật, từ đó cho thấy các phương pháp, đề tài và mục tiêu nghiên cứu chủ đạo đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.[180]

Triết học lịch sử
Bài chi tiết: Triết học lịch sử
Triết học lịch sử[q] suy xét những nền tảng lý thuyết của lịch sử. Bộ môn này quan tâm cả về bản thân quá khứ như là một chuỗi các sự kiện liên kết lẫn nhau và về lĩnh vực học thuật chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình đó. Những hiểu biết và cách tiếp cận từ một số phân nhánh triết học khác như siêu hình học, tri thức luận, thông diễn học và luân lý học có ảnh hưởng nhất định đến triết học lịch sử.[182]

Khi suy xét quá trình lịch sử, triết gia khám phá những thực thể cơ bản làm nên các hiện tượng lịch sử. Một số cách tiếp cận phụ thuộc chủ yếu vào niềm tin và hành động của cá nhân còn số khác bao hàm cả tập thể và các thực thể chung khác như văn minh, thiết chế, ý thức hệ và lực lượng xã hội.[183] Một chủ đề liên quan quan tâm bản chất của các cơ chế nhân quả liên kết những sự kiện lịch sử với nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng.[184] Một quan điểm cho rằng có những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử để xác định hướng tiếp diễn của sự kiện, tương tự như các định luật trong khoa học tự nhiên. Theo một góc nhìn khác, quan hệ nhân quả giữa các sự kiện lịch sử là duy nhất và được định hình bởi những yếu tố tùy cơ.[185] Trước đây, một số nhà triết học đã đưa ra luận cứ rằng hướng đi tổng quát của chiều dài lịch sử luôn tuân theo những quy luật lớn. Theo một luận điểm, lịch sử có tính tuần hoàn, tức là ở quy mô đủ lớn thì các sự kiện riêng lẻ hoặc xu hướng chung luôn lặp lại theo chu kỳ. Một lý thuyết khác khẳng định lịch sử là một quy trình tuyến tính có mục đích, đang chuyển động tới một mục tiêu xác định trước.[186][r]

Các chủ đề triết học lịch sử và sử luận có điểm tương đồng do chúng cùng quan tâm đến tiêu chuẩn của lý luận lịch sử. Nhà sử luận thường tập trung nhiều vào mô tả các phương pháp và tiến trình phát triển cụ thể trong nghiên cứu lịch sử. Trái lại, nhà triết học lịch sử có thiên hướng khám phá những quy luật tổng quát hơn, bao gồm đặt ra những câu hỏi đánh giá về việc phương pháp và giả thiết nào là đúng đắn.[188] Lý luận lịch sử đôi khi được vận dụng làm phương pháp giải thích hiện tượng trong triết học và các bộ môn khác. Phương pháp này, vốn hay gọi là chủ nghĩa lịch sử, lập luận rằng hiểu biết về một sự vật hay hiện tượng nào đó đòi hỏi phải nắm được bối cảnh lịch sử đặc thù hoặc quá trình tiến hóa của nó. Ví dụ, chủ nghĩa lịch sử về chân lý cho rằng chân lý phụ thuộc vào hoàn cảnh lịch sử, tức là không thể tồn tại chân lý xuyên lịch sử. Chủ nghĩa lịch sử tương phản với các hướng tiếp cận tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết vượt thời gian và phổ quát về chủ thể.[189]

Khách quan lịch sử
Nhiều tranh cãi trong triết học lịch sử xoay quanh khả năng tồn tại một tường thuật khách quan về lịch sử. Nhiều nhà lý thuyết nhận định lý tưởng đó là không thể đạt được và chỉ ra nguyên nhân nằm ở bản chất chủ quan trong cách lý giải sự kiện, khía cạnh tự sự của lịch sử cũng như ảnh hưởng của giá trị và thiên kiến cá nhân trong quan điểm và hành động của các nhân vật lịch sử và nhà sử học. Theo một góc nhìn, một số dữ kiện nhất định có tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như dữ kiện về thời điểm xảy ra hạn hán hoặc quân đội nào bị đánh bại. Song, góc nhìn này không đảm bảo tính khách quan tổng quát do sử gia vẫn phải lý giải và tổng hợp dữ kiện để đi đến một tự sự chung phản ánh các xu hướng và tiến trình phát triển lớn.[190] Vì vậy, một số nhà sử học như G. M. Trevelyan và Keith Jenkins đã khẳng định toàn bộ lịch sử đều có thiên kiến và cho rằng tự sự lịch sử không thể tách rời khỏi những giả định chủ quan và phán xét giá trị.[191]

Một số cách nhìn gắn với chủ nghĩa duy thực, chủ nghĩa kinh nghiệm và chủ nghĩa tái thiết[192] xem lịch sử là sự tìm kiếm chân lý hoặc tri thức, những gì mà chúng xem là có thể phục dựng được qua việc đánh giá nghiêm ngặt và diễn giải cẩn trọng các bằng chứng.[193][s] Nhiều học giả khác phê phán quan điểm đó, nhấn mạnh vào bản chất chủ quan và thiên vị của tri thức lịch sử.[t] Những nhà chủ nghĩa quan điểm cho rằng quan điểm lịch sử vốn dĩ đã có tính chủ quan do đòi hỏi phải chọn lọc sử liệu hay nghiên cứu cụ thể và xác định thông tin nào có thể coi là sự thật lịch sử. Họ lập luận mọi phát biểu chỉ có thể mang tính khách quan trong phạm vi nội tại hoặc khi xét tương đối với một trong nhiều góc nhìn lịch sử cạnh tranh lẫn nhau.[198] Một cách nhìn theo chủ nghĩa hoài nghi hoặc thuyết tương đối cực đoan hơn còn khẳng định không có tri thức lịch sử nào có thể được chứng tỏ là khách quan.[199][u] Sự nhấn mạnh về tính chủ quan đó đã được mở rộng trong các lý thuyết hậu hiện đại, vốn nhận định con người không thể nhận thức quá khứ một cách khách quan bởi ý nghĩa của lịch sử thực chất được kiến tạo qua văn bản do con người sáng tạo ra với ngôn ngữ "cấu thành nên thế giới theo cách mà chúng ta nhận thức nó".[201][v] Đáp lại xu hướng trên, các nhà tân duy thực khẳng định lại vai trò trung tâm của phương pháp luận kinh nghiệm trong phân tích lịch sử. Họ thừa nhận sức ảnh hưởng của đánh giá chủ quan nhưng tin rằng chân lý lịch sử vẫn có khả năng đạt tới được.[203][w]

Giáo dục

Lịch sử là môn bắt buộc tại trường học ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204]
Lịch sử là một bộ phận trong chương trình học tại trường phổ thông ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204] Giáo dục lịch sử giai đoạn đầu hướng tới khơi dậy sự hứng thú cho học sinh về quá khứ và giúp học sinh làm quen với các khái niệm cơ bản của tư tưởng lịch sử. Bằng việc xây dựng nhận thức lịch sử nền tảng, môn lịch sử hướng đến nuôi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc cá nhân và cộng đồng trên cơ sở hiểu biết về nguồn gốc văn hóa.[205] Môn học thường đi theo hình thức tự sự qua việc trình bày những câu chuyện đơn giản, tập trung vào các nhân vật lịch sử hoặc nguồn gốc của ngày lễ, lễ hội và tập quán địa phương.[206] Giáo dục lịch sử nâng cao ở trường trung học bao hàm phạm vi đề tài rộng hơn, từ lịch sử cổ đại đến hiện đại ở cả cấp độ địa phương và toàn cầu. Giai đoạn giáo dục này còn nhằm giúp học sinh làm quen với các phương pháp nghiên cứu lịch sử, bao gồm năng lực lý giải và đánh giá phê phán luận điểm lịch sử.[207]

Có nhiều phương pháp giảng dạy được giáo viên lịch sử áp dụng, bao gồm thuyết trình về các tiến trình phát triển lịch sử, đặt câu hỏi để tạo sự tương tác và kích thích tư duy phản biện, hoặc tổ chức thảo luận nhóm về các đề tài lịch sử. Học sinh làm việc trực tiếp với sử liệu để học cách phân tích và lý giải bằng chứng ở cả hình thức cá nhân và làm việc nhóm. Các em cũng tham gia ghi chép lịch sử để phát triển kỹ năng liên kết tư duy một cách rõ ràng và thuyết phục. Đánh giá qua kiểm tra viết hoặc vấn đáp được thực hiện nhằm đảm bảo đạt được các mục tiêu của môn học.[208] Phương pháp truyền thống trong giáo dục lịch sử thường là trình bày nhiều dữ kiện như ngày xảy ra sự kiện lớn và tên tuổi của các nhân vật lịch sử mà học sinh phải ghi nhớ. Ngược lại, một số cách tiếp cận hiện đại chú trọng khuyến khích tương tác tích cực và hiểu biết liên ngành sâu hơn về các quy luật tổng quát, tập trung vào cả những gì đã xảy ra, vì sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng đối với hiện tại.[209]

Giáo dục lịch sử ở trường công lập phục vụ nhiều mục đích. Một kỹ năng cốt lõi mà môn này hướng đến là năng lực lịch sử, tức khả năng lĩnh hội, phân tích phê phán và phản ứng trước diễn giải lịch sử. Bằng nhận thức về các tiến trình phát triển lớn trong quá khứ, học sinh có thể làm quen với nhiều bối cảnh của đời sống con người, từ đó hiểu rõ hơn thời đại mà mình đang sống cùng với các nền văn hóa đa dạng. Giáo dục lịch sử còn nhằm bồi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc văn hóa qua việc kết nối học sinh với các di sản, truyền thống và phong tục tập quán, chẳng hạn như giới thiệu về những yếu tố biểu tượng gồm di tích, tượng đài, nhân vật lịch sử và lễ hội.[210] Hiểu biết về quá khứ chung và di sản văn hóa có khả năng đóng góp cho sự hình thành bản sắc dân tộc và giúp học sinh sẵn sàng trở thành công dân tích cực. Khía cạnh chính trị này của giáo dục lịch sử có thể dẫn đến tranh cãi về việc nên đưa những chủ đề nào vào sách giáo khoa phổ thông và thậm chí đã từng gây ra cái gọi là chiến luận về lịch sử đối với chương trình học ở một số khu vực.[211] Yếu tố chính trị có khả năng làm các đề tài nhạy cảm bị diễn giải theo hướng thiên lệch nhằm củng cố hình ảnh di sản quốc gia một cách tích cực hơn so với thực tế.[212][x]

Giáo dục không chính quy qua triển lãm tạo tác lịch sử tại các bảo tàng là một bộ phận của lịch sử đại chúng.[214]
Ngoài giáo dục chính quy trong nhà trường, lịch sử còn được giảng dạy theo hình thức không chính quy ngoài lớp học. Lịch sử đại chúng được thể hiện tại những nơi như bảo tàng và khu tưởng niệm, trong đó thường chọn lọc một số hiện vật để chuyển tải những câu chuyện lịch sử cụ thể.[214] Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm lịch sử phổ biến, vốn có mục tiêu làm cho quá khứ trở nên hấp dẫn và dễ tiếp cận đến đối tượng khán giả rộng rãi và không chuyên trong các phương tiện truyền thông như sách, chương trình truyền hình hay nội dung trực tuyến.[215] Một phương tiện giáo dục lịch sử không chính quy khác là truyền thống truyền miệng với sự lưu truyền những tự sự về quá khứ qua nhiều thế hệ.[216]

Các lĩnh vực khác
Lịch sử sử dụng một phương pháp luận liên ngành dựa trên những phát kiến từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, địa chất học, di truyền học, nhân loại học và ngôn ngữ học.[217][y] Khảo cổ học nghiên cứu những tạo tác lịch sử do con người chế tạo và các hình thức văn hóa vật thể khác. Những phát hiện của giới khảo cổ mang lại hiểu biết quan trọng về các hoạt động của con người và quá trình phát triển văn hóa trong quá khứ.[219] Sự diễn giải bằng chứng khảo cổ đặt ra những thách thức riêng, khác biệt so với việc phân tích nhóm tác phẩm lịch sử thông thường ghi chép bằng chữ viết. Điều này đồng thời cũng mở ra những cơ hội mới từ việc trình bày thông tin chưa được ghi chép, cho phép sử gia tiếp cận quá khứ của những xã hội chưa có chữ viết và các nhóm thiểu số trong xã hội có chữ viết qua sự nghiên cứu di tích văn hóa vật chất. Trước khi khảo cổ học hiện đại xuất hiện vào thế kỷ 19, nghiên cứu đồ cổ là nền tảng ban đầu của bộ môn này và đóng vai trò chủ yếu trong bảo tồn tạo tác lịch sử.[220]

Địa chất học và các môn khoa học Trái Đất khác giúp sử gia hiểu được bối cảnh môi trường và các quá trình vật lý ảnh hưởng đến xã hội trong quá khứ, bao gồm điều kiện khí hậu, cảnh quan và hiện tượng tự nhiên.[221] Di truyền học cung cấp thông tin then chốt về nguồn gốc tiến hóa của loài người, di dân, tổ tiên và biến đổi nhân khẩu học.[222] Nhân loại học tìm hiểu văn hóa và hành vi của con người với các khía cạnh như cơ cấu xã hội, hệ tín ngưỡng và thực hành nghi lễ, mang đến cơ sở tri thức cho việc lý giải sự kiện lịch sử.[223] Ngôn ngữ học lịch sử nghiên cứu sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ theo thời gian, có vai trò cần thiết khi cần diễn giải văn bản cổ đại và đồng thời cũng cung cấp thông tin về quy luật di dân và trao đổi văn hóa.[224] Giới sử học còn sử dụng bằng chứng từ các lĩnh vực khác thuộc khoa học vật lý, khoa học sinh học và khoa học xã hội cùng với nhân văn học.[225]

Do có liên quan đến ý thức hệ và bản sắc dân tộc, lịch sử có quan hệ gần gũi với chính trị và những lý thuyết lịch sử có thể tác động trực tiếp đến quyết định chính trị. Chẳng hạn, việc một nước cố gắng sáp nhập lãnh thổ của nước khác theo chủ nghĩa phục hồi lãnh thổ thường có nguyên nhân nằm ở các lý thuyết lịch sử cho rằng vùng lãnh thổ tranh chấp đó thuộc về nước đầu tiên trong quá khứ.[226] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò trọng tâm ở cái gọi là tôn giáo lịch sử, vốn đặt nền tảng giáo lý của mình trên những sự kiện lịch sử. Ví dụ, Kitô giáo thường được phân loại là tôn giáo lịch sử do tập trung vào các sự kiện xoay quanh Chúa Giê-su.[227] Lịch sử còn có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực khác thông qua nghiên cứu về quá khứ của chính những lĩnh vực đó như lịch sử khoa học, toán học, triết học và nghệ thuật.[228]

^ Lịch sử Vĩ đại (Big History) do nhà sử học David Christian xây dựng vào cuối thập niên 1980 có phạm vi trải dài đến Vụ Nổ Lớn, bao hàm sự phát triển vũ trụ và quá trình tiến hóa sinh học của sự sống bên cạnh lịch sử thế giới.[9]
^ Các sử gia thời kỳ đầu như Herodotos và Thucydides đã coi tự sự của Homeros cùng những nhà thơ khác là không tưởng và không chính xác.[14]
^ Một cách nhìn có liên quan là chủ nghĩa xét lại lịch sử, vốn nhằm lật lại những quan điểm đã được củng cố về lịch sử. Xét lại lịch sử gồm nhiều dạng, từ đưa ra bằng chứng và phương pháp mới chống lại tư duy hiện tại đến chỉ trích giá trị hoặc tầm quan trọng của các sự kiện hoặc nhân vật lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ chủ nghĩa xét lại theo nghĩa trung lập để chỉ bất kỳ sự bác bỏ hoặc diễn giải lại luận điểm chính thống. Số khác cho rằng thuật ngữ gắn với việc làm bỏ qua bằng chứng xác thực và kết hợp các quan niệm tương đối hoặc hoài nghi một cách cực đoan để biện minh góc nhìn ngụy sử, cố ý làm suy giảm uy tín của tri thức đã được khẳng định về các sự kiện lịch sử thông qua phê phán tri thức luận.[21]
^ Hiểu theo nghĩa hẹp, phương pháp lịch sử đôi khi chỉ bao gồm việc đánh giá hoặc phê phán sử liệu.[29]
^ Định nghĩa chính xác về nguồn sơ cấp và nguồn thứ cấp là vấn đề còn tranh cãi. Việc một nguồn tư liệu cụ thể được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp không phải lúc nào cũng có sự thống nhất. Ví dụ, trong trường hợp một người không xuất hiện trong một cuộc bạo loạn nhưng đưa tin về vụ việc đó ngay sau khi xảy ra, một số nhà sử học xem tin bài đó là nguồn sơ cấp còn số khác xem đó là nguồn thứ cấp.[37]
^ Quan niệm lấy đánh giá sử liệu làm trọng tâm của Leopold von Ranke có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến nghiên cứu lịch sử.[40]
^ Bối cảnh và thời điểm xuất bản tài liệu thường được xét đến để hiểu được nghĩa của các thuật ngữ mà tài liệu đang sử dụng. Chẳng hạn, nếu một tài liệu tiếng Anh dùng từ awful, sử gia phải xác định xem từ này thể hiện nghĩa hiện đại 'tồi tệ' hay nghĩa cũ 'đáng kinh ngạc'.[42]
^ Điều này trở nên đặc biệt khó khăn nếu các sử liệu khác nhau đưa ra thông tin dường như mâu thuẫn nhau.[44]
^ Sự sáng tạo và trí tưởng tượng cần có cho bước này là một trong những lý do khiến một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn nghệ thuật thay vì là một môn khoa học.[45]
^ Chẳng hạn, Martha Washington đốt toàn bộ thư từ giữa bà với chồng George Washington, để lại khoảng trống kéo dài hàng chục năm về mối quan hệ giữa hai người.[52] Sự tồn tại cấm kỵ (ví dụ như cấm kỵ đồng tính luyến ái) là một nguyên nhân khác gây ra khoảng trống, có thể dẫn đến hiện tượng có ít thông tin về chủ đề được ghi lại.[51] Thông lệ xóa tên người đã mất bị xem là kẻ thù khỏi ghi chép công khai được gọi là damnatio memoriae.[53]
^ Có nhiều bất đồng về thời điểm bắt đầu và kết thúc chính xác của mỗi thời kỳ. Các cách phân kỳ khác có thể lấy những khoảng thời gian chồng chéo nhau hoặc khác biệt nhiều so với thông thường.[64]

^ Nhấn mạnh mối quan hệ mật thiết giữa địa lý và lịch sử, Jules Michelet viết trong lời nói đầu cuốn Histoire de France năm 1869: "không có cơ sở địa lý, con người, những người làm nên lịch sử, dường như đang quá hạnh phúc".[80]
^ Herodotos thường được xem là "cha đẻ của lịch sử" nhưng cũng bị gọi là "cha đẻ của dối trá" bởi không phải mọi tự sự của ông đều đáng tin.[141]
^ Khía cạnh này cũng có thể thấy ở một mức độ nào đó trong những tác phẩm của các sử gia Hy Lạp như Herodotos và Polybius.[144]
^ Lý thuyết lịch sử là một thuật ngữ có liên hệ mật thiết đôi lúc được dùng làm từ đồng nghĩa.[181]
^ Một số triết gia có luận điểm tương tự như Francis Fukuyama rằng "hồi kết của lịch sử" đã đến dựa trên tuyên bố cho rằng quá trình tiến triển ý thức hệ của loài người đã đạt đến cực hạn.[187]
^ Nhà sử học người Đức Leopold von Ranke là một trong những người đề xướng quan trọng nhất của cách tiếp cận khoa học này vào thế kỷ 19.[194] Sir Geoffrey Elton, Arthur Marwick và E. P. Thompson là ba trong số những học giả thời hiện đại tán thành với góc nhìn trên.[193]
^ Những phê phán này dựa trên một số luận cứ như: việc phục dựng toàn bộ quá khứ là bất khả; khi sự kiện đã trôi qua, không thể kiểm chứng tường thuật so với sự kiện mà chỉ có thể kiểm chứng so với tường thuật khác; ghi chép lịch sử do sử gia nối kết và xây dựng, và quá trình tạo lập tự sự bao gồm lý giải và đọc hiểu có chọn lọc;[195] tự thân bằng chứng cũng là chủ quan một cách tất yếu do nội dung trong bằng chứng được nối kết thông qua người tạo ra nó và sự tồn tại qua các quá trình chọn lọc.[196] Từ góc nhìn này, nhận thức muộn và lý thuyết hóa hiện đại cũng cho phép sử gia kết hợp bằng chứng và đưa ra lý giải vốn chỉ có thể thấy được sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra dưới góc độ thiên lệch, tức là lịch sử dưới hình thức quá khứ đã biết là sản phẩm do con người tạo ra.[197]
^ Trong những người đề xướng quan điểm theo thiên hướng thuyết tương đối có E. H. Carr, tác giả của What Is History? (1961) vốn khảo sát tác động từ bối cảnh lịch sử và xã hội đến cách lựa chọn và phân tích dữ kiện của giới sử học.[200]
^ Một số học giả cho rằng việc nhận diện bản chất chủ quan của tư liệu lịch sử là cơ hội để mở ra các lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và phương pháp mới trong làm việc với chủ thể lịch sử; đồng thời cũng mang lại những hướng tiếp cận mới trong phân tích sử liệu, phê phán tự sự chính thống và cho phép nhà sử học làm việc với nhiều khái niệm khác nhau.[202]
^ Richard J. Evans là một trong số những học giả ủng hộ quan điểm này.[203]
^ Chẳng hạn, một số sách giáo khoa lịch sử cấp trung học phổ thông của Nhật Bản đã bị chỉ trích do cố ý hạ thấp những hoạt động thực dân và tham chiến của nước này.[213]
^ Chúng đôi khi được gộp lại thành một nhóm có tên khoa học phụ trợ của lịch sử.[218]

Lịch sử là nghiên cứu có hệ thống về quá khứ, tập trung chủ yếu vào quá khứ của loài người. Dưới hình thức một môn học, lịch sử phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng để tường thuật lại những gì đã xảy ra và giải thích lý do cũng như cách thức mà sự việc đó xảy ra. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội còn số khác xem đây là bộ phận của nhân văn học hoặc là một bộ môn hỗn hợp. Có nhiều tranh luận tương tự xoay quanh mục đích của lịch sử, chẳng hạn như liệu mục tiêu chính của nó là để khám phá chân lý (hướng lý thuyết) hay là rút ra bài học kinh nghiệm từ quá khứ (hướng thực tiễn). Theo cách hiểu suy rộng, ngoài ý nghĩa lĩnh vực học thuật, thuật ngữ lịch sử còn chỉ cả bản thân quá khứ, những thời điểm trong quá khứ hoặc các văn bản riêng lẻ liên quan đến quá khứ.

Nghiên cứu lịch sử phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tư liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp để tái hiện các sự kiện trong quá khứ và xác nhận diễn giải. Phê phán sử liệu là một phương pháp được sử dụng để đánh giá những nguồn này dựa trên tính xác thực, nội dung và độ tin cậy. Giới sử học thường cố gắng kết hợp quan điểm giữa nhiều nguồn tài liệu để tạo nên mạch tự sự thống nhất. Các trường phái tư tưởng khác nhau như chủ nghĩa thực chứng, trường phái Annales, chủ nghĩa Marx và chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại có cách tiếp cận phương pháp luận khác nhau.

Lịch sử là một bộ môn rộng bao gồm nhiều nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào các giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể (ví dụ như thời kỳ cổ đại), còn số khác hướng đến những khu vực địa lý nhất định (chẳng hạn như lịch sử châu Phi). Theo phạm vi lĩnh vực, lịch sử có thể được phân loại thành lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử quân sự, lịch sử xã hội, lịch sử kinh tế, v.v. Các phân nhánh theo loại tư liệu và phương pháp nghiên cứu bao gồm lịch sử định lượng, lịch sử so sánh và lịch sử truyền miệng.

Lịch sử ra đời dưới hình thức lĩnh vực nghiên cứu ở thời cổ đại thay thế những câu chuyện truyền thuyết, bắt nguồn chủ yếu ở Hy Lạp, Trung Quốc và sau này là thế giới Hồi giáo. Ghi chép lịch sử trải qua nhiều biến đổi theo thời gian và ngày càng có tính chuyên nghiệp cao, nhất là vào thế kỷ 19 với sự xuất hiện một phương pháp luận nghiêm ngặt cùng hàng loạt cơ sở học thuật được thành lập. Lịch sử có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực như sử luận, triết học, giáo dục và chính trị.

Định nghĩa
Theo sử gia Đào Duy Anh (1932), lịch sử (ánh xạ với tiếng Pháp histoire) được định nghĩa là "biên chép những sự biến thiên diên cách trải qua các đời" hoặc "biên chép những việc lớn của quốc gia, xã hội".[1]

Dưới dạng một bộ môn học thuật, lịch sử là ngành nghiên cứu về quá khứ, đặc biệt là quá khứ của loài người.[2] Mục tiêu của lịch sử là khái quát và tái hiện những gì đã xảy ra bằng cách thu thập và phân tích các bằng chứng để tổng hợp thành tường thuật. Những tường thuật này làm sáng tỏ diễn biến vụ việc, nguyên nhân hình thành và bối cảnh lịch sử cụ thể, qua đó giải thích điều kiện bối cảnh và cơ chế nhân quả liên quan đến chúng. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn phân tích ý nghĩa của những sự việc trong quá khứ và khám phá những động cơ đã thúc đẩy hành động của con người.[3]

Theo một định nghĩa khác, lịch sử chỉ bản thân các sự kiện trong quá khứ. Theo cách hiểu này, lịch sử chính là những gì đã xảy ra thay vì là môn học thuật nghiên cứu những điều đã xảy ra. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn có một nghĩa khác là ghi chép về quá khứ dưới hình thức văn bản. Văn bản lịch sử là sản phẩm văn hóa phản ánh quá trình lý giải và tái cấu trúc thường xuyên từ các nhà sử học. Cách tường thuật trong các văn bản lịch sử có thể thay đổi khi nhà sử học tìm thấy bằng chứng mới hoặc lý giải lại sử liệu hiện có. Trái lại, bản thân quá khứ là bất biến và không thể thay đổi.[4] Một số sử gia tập trung vào các khía cạnh lý giải và giải thích để phân biệt lịch sử với biên niên sử, với luận điểm rằng biên niên sử chỉ liệt kê các sự kiện theo trình tự thời gian còn lịch sử hướng đến hiểu biết toàn diện về nguyên nhân, bối cảnh đến hệ quả.[5]

Từ trước đến nay, lịch sử chủ yếu nghiên cứu những gì được con người ghi lại bằng chữ viết. Vì thế, môn này tập trung vào các sự kiện xảy ra sau khi con người phát minh ra chữ viết (gọi là lịch sử ghi chép), còn thời kỳ trước đó, gọi là thời tiền sử,[a] thường do ngành khảo cổ học nghiên cứu.[7] Tuy nhiên, sang thế kỷ 20, các nhà sử học đã mở rộng phạm vi và bắt đầu quan tâm nhiều hơn đến quá khứ của loài người trước thời điểm chữ viết ra đời.[8][b]

Giới sử học tranh luận về việc lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội hay là bộ phận của nhân văn học. Tương tự như với khoa học xã hội, nhà sử học xây dựng giả thuyết, thu thập bằng chứng khách quan và trình bày luận điểm dựa trên bằng chứng đó. Mặt khác, lịch sử cũng liên hệ chặt chẽ với nhân văn học vì phụ thuộc vào các khía cạnh chủ quan gắn liền với sự lý giải, kể chuyện, kinh nghiệm của con người và di sản văn hóa.[10] Một số sử gia ủng hộ phân loại theo chỉ một trong hai cách nêu trên, còn số khác xem lịch sử là một môn hỗn hợp không thuộc về phạm trù cụ thể nào theo hướng loại trừ với phạm trù còn lại.[11] Lịch sử đối lập với ngụy sử, một thuật ngữ chỉ sử luận lệch chuẩn do dùng bằng chứng lịch sử gây tranh cãi, cố tình bỏ qua bằng chứng đã xác thực hoặc sử dụng cách thức khác để bóp méo ghi chép lịch sử. Thường được thúc đẩy bởi một số ý thức hệ nhất định, ngụy sử bắt chước phương pháp lịch sử để truyền bá cách tường thuật thiên lệch, gây hiểu lầm, không dựa trên phân tích nghiêm ngặt và thiếu sự đồng thuận về mặt học thuật.[12]

Mục đích
Đã có nhiều ý kiến được đưa ra về mục đích hoặc giá trị của lịch sử. Một số sử gia cho rằng mục đích chính của lịch sử chỉ đơn giản là tìm ra chân lý về quá khứ. Theo quan điểm này, mưu cầu chân lý công tâm là một mục đích tự thân và không nên bị ảnh hưởng bởi những mục đích bên ngoài như chính trị hay ý thức hệ, vì như vậy có thể xuyên tạc quá khứ và ảnh hưởng xấu đến độ chính xác của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Khi đóng vai trò đi tìm chân lý, lịch sử còn có nhiệm vụ làm sáng tỏ những câu chuyện truyền miệng hay thần thoại đã tồn tại từ lâu nhưng thiếu bằng chứng xác thực.[13][c]

Một góc nhìn khác cho rằng giá trị cốt lõi của lịch sử nằm ở những bài học kinh nghiệm để lại cho nhân loại ngày nay. Ý tưởng ở đây là hiểu rõ quá khứ sẽ giúp con người ra quyết định tốt hơn, chẳng hạn như để tránh lặp lại sai lầm của quá khứ.[15] Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn giúp ta hiểu về bản chất con người. Trong những bối cảnh và thời đại khác nhau, con người sẽ cư xử khác đi, giống như việc người ta du lịch để học hỏi về các nền văn hóa mới vậy.[16] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò là chất keo gắn kết xã hội. Khi nhiều người có chung một quá khứ, họ hình thành một bản sắc tập thể vững chắc, nhờ đó các di sản và giá trị văn hóa được bảo tồn và lưu truyền qua nhiều thế hệ.[17] Đối với một số học giả, bao gồm giới sử gia Whig và học giả Mác-xít E. H. Carr, lịch sử là chìa khóa để am hiểu hiện tại[18] và (theo Carr) định hình tương lai.[19]

Lịch sử đôi lúc cũng được sử dụng làm công cụ chính trị và công cụ tuyên truyền, ví dụ như ca ngợi những truyền thống cũ nhằm giúp giới cầm quyền duy trì hiện trạng hoặc phơi bày những bất công trong quá khứ để thúc đẩy thay đổi.[20] Ở dạng cực đoan, người ta cố ý bỏ qua hoặc xuyên tạc bằng chứng để tạo ra những câu chuyện hoàn toàn sai lệch, dẫn đến ngụy sử hoặc xuyên tạc lịch sử.[12][d] Một số ví dụ tiêu biểu gồm phủ nhận sự tồn tại của nạn diệt chủng Holocaust, diệt chủng Armenia, thảm sát Nam Kinh và Holodomor.[22]

Từ nguyên

Từ lịch sử trong tiếng Việt là cách đọc Hán-Việt của hai chữ 歷史 (lìshǐ).[1]

Từ history trong tiếng Anh bắt nguồn từ chữ Hy Lạp cổ ἵστωρ (histōr) tức 'người có học, thông thái'. Từ này phái sinh từ Hy Lạp cổ ἱστορία (historiā), vốn mang nghĩa rộng gắn với tra vấn nói chung và đưa ra lời chứng. Thuật ngữ sau đó được chuyển tự sang tiếng Latinh cổ điển thành historia. Vào thời Hy Lạp hóa và La Mã, ý nghĩa của thuật ngữ có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào khía cạnh tường thuật và nghệ thuật trình bày thay vì nghiên cứu và lời chứng.[24]

Từ history du nhập vào tiếng Anh trung đại vào thế kỷ 14 thông qua chữ histoire của tiếng Pháp cổ.[25] Lúc bấy giờ, nó có nghĩa là 'câu chuyện, truyện kể', gồm cả tường thuật có thật và hư cấu. Vào thế kỷ 15, nghĩa của từ này thay đổi theo hướng bao hàm nhánh tri thức nghiên cứu quá khứ đi đôi với tự sự về quá khứ.[26] Đến thế kỷ 18 và 19, chữ history dần liên hệ chặt chẽ hơn với tường thuật thực tế và tra vấn dựa trên bằng chứng cùng thời điểm với giai đoạn chuyên nghiệp hóa của nghiên cứu lịch sử, một ý nghĩa hiện còn mang tính chi phối trong cách dùng từ đương đại.[27] Ý nghĩa bao hàm cả truyện kể đơn thuần và tự sự có thật về quá khứ cũng hiện diện trong thuật ngữ lịch sử ở nhiều ngôn ngữ châu Âu khác như histoire (tiếng Pháp), storia (tiếng Ý) và Geschichte (tiếng Đức).[28]

Phương pháp
Bài chi tiết: Phương pháp lịch sử
Phương pháp lịch sử là một tập hợp các kỹ thuật mà giới sử học áp dụng để nghiên cứu và lý giải quá khứ, bao gồm các quy trình thu thập, đánh giá và tổng hợp chứng cứ.[e] Phương pháp lịch sử nhằm đảm bảo tính nghiêm ngặt, chính xác và độ tin cậy học thuật về cách lựa chọn, phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng lịch sử.[30] Nghiên cứu lịch sử thường bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi nghiên cứu để xác định phạm vi đề tài. Một số câu hỏi nghiên cứu tập trung đơn thuần vào mô tả những gì đã xảy ra, trong khi số khác hướng đến giải thích lý do một sự kiện cụ thể xảy ra, bác bỏ giả thuyết đã có hoặc xác nhận một giả thuyết mới.[31]

Sử liệu và phê phán sử liệu
Để giải đáp câu hỏi nghiên cứu, các sử gia sử dụng nhiều loại bằng chứng khác nhau để tái hiện lại quá khứ và củng cố cho kết luận của mình. Bằng chứng lịch sử thường được chia thành nguồn sơ cấp và thứ cấp.[32] Nguồn sơ cấp là những thứ được hình thành ngay trong thời kỳ đó. Có nhiều loại nguồn sơ cấp như tài liệu chính thức, thư từ, nhật ký, lời kể của nhân chứng, ảnh chụp, bản ghi âm hoặc ghi hình. Tư liệu sơ cấp còn bao gồm dấu tích lịch sử được tìm thấy qua khảo cổ học, địa chất học và y khoa, ví dụ như hiện vật và hóa thạch lấy từ các cuộc khai quật. Nguồn sơ cấp cho ta bằng chứng trực tiếp nhất về các sự kiện quá khứ.[33]

Nguồn thứ cấp là tư liệu phân tích hoặc lý giải thông tin của tư liệu khác.[35] Việc một nguồn tài liệu được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp phụ thuộc cả vào bản chất lẫn mục đích sử dụng của tư liệu đó. Chẳng hạn, tài liệu nghiên cứu về chế độ nô lệ được viết bằng cách phân tích các tài liệu lịch sử sẽ là nguồn thứ cấp khi nói về chế độ nô lệ nhưng lại là nguồn sơ cấp về quan điểm của sử gia đó.[36][f] Một trong những tiêu chuẩn phải có của một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử đáng tin cậy là tính nhất quán với các tư liệu đã có. Nếu các nhà sử học tìm thấy những nguồn tài liệu mới, họ có thể sẽ phải sửa đổi hoặc bác bỏ những câu chuyện lịch sử đã và đang được công nhận.[38] Để tìm kiếm và tiếp cận với sử liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp, các sử gia thường tra cứu kho lưu trữ, thư viện và bảo tàng. Kho lưu trữ đóng vai trò chủ chốt qua việc lưu lại và công khai vô số tư liệu nguyên bản đến giới nghiên cứu một cách có hệ thống và dễ tiếp cận. Nhờ những tiến bộ công nghệ, giới sử học đang ngày càng tận dụng nguồn tài nguyên trực tuyến với các cơ sở dữ liệu phong phú cùng những kỹ thuật tìm kiếm và truy cập tài liệu.[39]

Phê phán sử liệu là quá trình phân tích và đánh giá thông tin mà một tư liệu cung cấp.[g] Thông thường, quá trình này bắt đầu bằng phê phán ngoại tại, tức là đánh giá tính xác thực của sử liệu bằng cách đặt ra những câu hỏi như sử liệu này ra đời khi nào, ở đâu, ai là tác giả, mục đích người đó làm ra sử liệu là gì, sử liệu có từng bị chỉnh sửa gì sau thời điểm xuất bản hay không. Ngoài ra, phê phán ngoại tại còn bao gồm phân biệt giữa bản gốc, bản sao và bản làm giả.[41]

Phê phán nội tại là đánh giá nội dung của tư liệu, thường bắt đầu bằng việc làm rõ ý nghĩa những gì tư liệu muốn nói. Việc này bao gồm làm rõ nghĩa những từ ngữ có thể gây nhầm lẫn, hoặc nếu tài liệu viết bằng một ngôn ngữ lạ thì cần phải dịch nó ra.[h] Khi đã hiểu nội dung, bước quan trọng nhất là xác định tính chính xác: thông tin có đáng tin không, có bị bóp méo hay trình bày sai sự thật không, có đầy đủ không, có bỏ sót chi tiết quan trọng nào không. Một cách tiến hành những việc trên là đánh giá khả năng trình bày trung thực sự kiện được nghiên cứu của tác giả về mặt nguyên tắc. Ngoài ra, còn có một số phương pháp tiếp cận khác như đánh giá tầm ảnh hưởng của ý định hay thiên kiến từ tác giả và tham chiếu thông tin với các nguồn đáng tin cậy khác. Nhận biết về thiếu sót của sử liệu giúp các nhà sử học quyết định có nên tin tưởng sử liệu đó hay không, nếu có thì nên tin những khía cạnh gì và nên sử dụng nó như thế nào để xây dựng tường thuật.[43]

Tổng hợp lịch sử và các trường phái tư tưởng
Từ bước lựa chọn, phân tích và phê phán sử liệu, sử gia sẽ xác minh được một lượng lớn các luận điểm độc lập về quá khứ. Ở bước tiếp theo, đôi khi còn gọi là tổng hợp lịch sử, nhà sử học sẽ tìm hiểu cách thức liên kết những bằng chứng riêng lẻ đó thành một bức tranh tổng thể.[i] Việc xây dựng góc nhìn bao quát là cần thiết để có sự hiểu biết toàn diện về đề tài nghiên cứu. Đây là một khía cạnh sáng tạo[j] của ghi chép lịch sử nhằm tái hiện và lý giải những gì đã xảy ra thông qua việc xác định mối liên hệ giữa nhiều sự kiện khác nhau.[46] Nhờ đó, sử gia có thể xác định được những sự kiện nào đã diễn ra, nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng là gì.[47] Tuy không có kỹ thuật duy nhất nào được chấp nhận rộng rãi, giới sử học vẫn áp dụng nhiều công cụ và cách tiếp cận diễn giải trong quá trình trên.[48]

Auguste Comte là người phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng, ủng hộ tiếp cận lịch sử trên cơ sở khoa học.[49]
Một công cụ giúp khái quát và trình bày dễ hiểu các quá trình phát triển phức tạp là phân kỳ lịch sử, tức là chia một khoảng thời gian thành nhiều giai đoạn riêng biệt, mỗi giai đoạn được xác định bởi một chủ đề hoặc quá trình phát triển chủ đạo. Ví dụ, hệ thống ba thời đại thường được sử dụng để phân chia lịch sử loài người thuở đầu thành thời đại đồ đá, thời đại đồ đồng và thời đại đồ sắt dựa trên loại nguyên vật liệu và công nghệ chủ yếu đặc trưng cho từng thời kỳ.[50] Một phương pháp khác là nghiên cứu khoảng trống trong ghi chép lịch sử, tức những sự kiện đã từng xảy ra nhưng không để lại bằng chứng đáng kể nào. Những khoảng trống này có thể xuất hiện khi người đương thời cho rằng thông tin quá hiển nhiên nên không cần ghi lại, hoặc khi thông tin bị cố ý giấu giếm hay tiêu hủy.[51][k] Ngược lại, khi có sẵn các tập dữ liệu lớn thì sử gia có thể sử dụng hướng tiếp cận định lượng. Chẳng hạn, các nhà sử học kinh tế và xã hội thường áp dụng phương pháp phân tích thống kê để nhận diện quy luật và xu hướng trong phạm vi tập thể rộng lớn.[54]

Mỗi trường phái tư tưởng có quan điểm riêng về mặt phương pháp luận trong ghi chép lịch sử.[55] Những nhà sử học theo chủ nghĩa thực chứng xem nghiên cứu lịch sử là một hoạt động mang tính khoa học và cho rằng bằng chứng thực nghiệm đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tìm kiếm chân lý khách quan.[56] Trái lại, các nhà hậu hiện đại phủ nhận tính hợp lệ của những đại tự sự vốn được cho là mang lại một chân lý khách quan duy nhất. Chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại thay vào đó đề cao bản chất chủ quan của lý giải lịch sử và xem đây là nền tảng cho sự đa dạng của các quan điểm lịch sử khác nhau.[57] Những nhà Mác-xít cho rằng mọi sự phát triển lịch sử đều bắt nguồn từ động lực kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp.[58] Trường phái Annales tập trung nghiên cứu các xu hướng kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn, lấy những phương pháp định lượng và tiếp cận liên ngành làm trọng tâm.[59] Sử học nữ quyền nghiên cứu vai trò của giới tính xã hội trong lịch sử, đặc biệt quan tâm đến việc phân tích kinh nghiệm của phụ nữ và phê phán các quan niệm mang tính phụ quyền trong chép sử truyền thống.[60]

Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu
Lịch sử là một lĩnh vực nghiên cứu rộng bao gồm nhiều phân nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào một giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể còn số khác tập trung vào một khu vực địa lý hoặc đề tài nhất định. Một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử thường có thể có sự kết hợp nhiều hướng chuyên môn khác nhau; chẳng hạn, một tác phẩm về lịch sử kinh tế ở Ai Cập cổ đại có sự tổng hợp các góc nhìn về mặt thời gian, không gian và chủ đề. Đối với đề tài phạm vi rộng, lượng sử liệu sơ cấp liên quan thường quá lớn để có thể khảo cứu hết, buộc sử gia phải thu hẹp tầm vực chủ đề nghiên cứu hoặc sử dụng thêm tài liệu thứ cấp để đi đến kết luận tổng quan.[61]

Theo giai đoạn
Phân chia theo trình tự thời gian là một cách tiếp cận thường gặp để sắp xếp tiến trình lịch sử rộng lớn thành nhiều phân đoạn. Việc xác định các thời kỳ thường dựa trên những đặc trưng nổi bật của một giai đoạn nhất định cùng với các sự kiện quan trọng đánh dấu sự khởi đầu hoặc kết thúc những bước phát triển đó. Tùy vào bối cảnh nghiên cứu và mức độ chi tiết mà một thời kỳ có thể kéo dài từ vài thập kỷ đến hàng thế kỷ.[62] Một hướng tiếp cận tiêu biểu là chia lịch sử thế giới thành thời tiền sử, thời kỳ cổ đại, thời kỳ trung đại, thời kỳ cận đại và thời kỳ hiện đại.[63][l] Tuy nhiên, tùy theo khu vực và chủ đề nghiên cứu mà có thể có sự khác biệt về ranh giới thời gian giữa các thời kỳ trên và giới sử học cũng có thể sử dụng cách phân kỳ hoàn toàn khác.[65] Chẳng hạn, lịch sử Trung Quốc thường được phân kỳ theo các triều đại chính,[66] trong khi lịch sử châu Mỹ lại thường được chia theo các giai đoạn tiền Colombo, thực dân và hậu thực dân.[67]

Các nhà sử học sử dụng bằng chứng từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau để nghiên cứu thời tiền sử, bao gồm cả hóa thạch như Lucy.[68]
Nghiên cứu thời tiền sử bao gồm khảo sát quá trình tiến hóa của các loài người cổ cách đây vài triệu năm, dẫn đến sự xuất hiện của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu khoảng 200.000 năm trước.[69] Thời gian sau đó, loài người dần di cư khỏi châu Phi để cư trú ở hầu khắp Trái Đất. Về cuối thời tiền sử, những tiến bộ về công nghệ (nhất là trong chế tác công cụ) đã khiến nhiều cộng đồng người từ bỏ lối sống du mục quen thuộc dựa vào săn bắt và hái lượm và chuyển sang lối sống ít vận động dựa trên những hoạt động nông nghiệp sơ khai.[70] Sự thiếu vắng tài liệu thành văn từ thời kỳ này để lại nhiều thách thức đối với các nhà nghiên cứu và là nền tảng để cho ra đời một phương pháp tiếp cận liên ngành trên cơ sở tổng hợp những dạng bằng chứng khác từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, nhân loại học, cổ sinh vật học và địa chất học.[71]

Giới sử gia nghiên cứu thời cổ đại khảo sát sự hình thành các nền văn minh lớn đầu tiên ở những khu vực như Lưỡng Hà, Ai Cập, lưu vực sông Ấn, Trung Quốc và Peru, bắt đầu từ khoảng năm 3500 TCN tại một số nơi. Những biến đổi phức tạp trong xã hội, kinh tế và chính trị đã tạo điều kiện cho việc phát triển các hệ thống chữ viết đầu tiên. Nhờ những thành tựu mới về nông nghiệp, lượng lương thực thặng dư đã giúp các nền văn minh trên nuôi sống được quy mô dân số ngày càng lớn, kéo theo quá trình đô thị hóa, sự thành lập nhiều mạng lưới thương mại và sự xuất hiện những đế chế khu vực. Ở giai đoạn sau của thời cổ đại, đôi khi còn gọi là thời kỳ cổ điển, các xã hội tại Trung Quốc, Ấn Độ, Ba Tư và Địa Trung Hải tiếp tục mở rộng và đạt đến đỉnh cao mới về văn hóa, khoa học và chính trị. Cùng lúc đó, nhiều hệ thống tôn giáo và tư tưởng triết học lớn như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Do Thái giáo và triết học Hy Lạp cũng được hình thành tại đây.[72]

Trong nghiên cứu về thời kỳ trung đại (bắt đầu vào khoảng năm 500 CN), giới sử học đề cập đến tầm ảnh hưởng ngày càng sâu rộng của những tôn giáo lớn. Các tôn giáo truyền đạo như Phật giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo lan tỏa nhanh chóng và trở thành tôn giáo thế giới, đánh dấu bước chuyển dịch lớn về văn hóa khi dần thay thế nhiều hệ tín ngưỡng khác. Cùng thời điểm, các mạng lưới thương mại liên khu vực phát triển mạnh mẽ, thúc đẩy sự giao lưu về công nghệ và văn hóa. Vào thế kỷ 13 và 14, đế quốc Mông Cổ xâm lược nhiều vùng lãnh thổ ở châu Á và châu Âu và trở thành thế lực thống trị hàng đầu.[73]

Các sử gia chuyên nghiên cứu thời cận đại (bắt đầu khoảng năm 1500 CN) thường tập trung phân tích quá trình trỗi dậy và thâu tóm quyền lực toàn cầu của các nước châu Âu. Những nước đế quốc thuốc súng này đã tiến hành khai phá và thực dân hóa nhiều khu vực rộng lớn trên thế giới. Hệ quả là châu Mỹ được kết nối vào mạng lưới toàn cầu, khởi đầu cho một cuộc trao đổi sinh học quy mô lớn với sự di chuyển của cả thực vật, động vật, con người và mầm bệnh.[m] Cách mạng khoa học là xúc tác cho các phát kiến lớn và tăng tốc tiến bộ công nghệ, song song với đó là nhiều bước tiến khác về tri thức như chủ nghĩa nhân văn và thời kỳ Khai Sáng, mở đường cho tiến trình thế tục hóa.[75]

Cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp có tác động sâu rộng đến đời sống kinh tế và xã hội, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ xã hội nông nghiệp sang xã hội công nghiệp.[76]
Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử hiện đại (bắt đầu vào cuối thế kỷ 18), giới sử học quan tâm đến cách mà cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp làm chuyển dịch các nền kinh tế nhờ việc cho ra đời những phương thức sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Các cường quốc phương Tây thành lập những đế chế thực dân rộng lớn và củng cố ưu thế nhờ công nghệ quân sự công nghiệp hóa. Sự gia tăng trao đổi hàng hóa, tư tưởng và con người đánh dấu bước đầu của quá trình toàn cầu hóa. Hàng loạt cuộc cách mạng xã hội bùng nổ chống lại các chế độ chuyên quyền và thực dân, đặt nền móng cho những thể chế dân chủ. Nhiều lĩnh vực như khoa học, công nghệ, kinh tế, mức sống và dân số tăng trưởng với tốc độ chưa từng có bất chấp tàn phá nặng nề từ hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới, vốn đã làm thay đổi căn bản cán cân quyền lực quốc tế với sự suy yếu vai trò thống trị của châu Âu.[77]

Theo vị trí địa lý
Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng có thể được phân loại theo vị trí địa lý.[78] Yếu tố địa lý đóng vai trò quan trọng trong lịch sử do có ảnh hưởng đến sản xuất thực phẩm, tài nguyên thiên nhiên, hoạt động kinh tế, ranh giới chính trị và giao lưu văn hóa.[79][n] Một số tác phẩm lịch sử có phạm vi nghiên cứu chỉ ở những khu vực nhỏ như làng xã hay khu định cư, còn số khác tập trung vào các vùng lãnh thổ rộng lớn trải khắp toàn bộ châu lục, ví dụ như lịch sử châu Phi, châu Á, châu Âu, châu Mỹ và châu Đại Dương.[81]

Quần thể kim tự tháp Giza đại diện cho di sản lâu đời của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại.[82]
Lịch sử châu Phi khởi đầu với nghiên cứu về sự tiến hóa của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu.[83] Các nhà sử học cổ đại mô tả quá trình phát minh chữ viết và cái nôi của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại vào thiên niên kỷ 4 TCN.[84] Trong thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, nhiều nền văn minh và vương quốc tiêu biểu khác được hình thành tại Nubia, Axum, Carthage, Ghana, Mali và Songhay.[85] Hồi giáo bắt đầu lan truyền khắp Bắc Phi vào thế kỷ 7 CN và trở thành đức tin lớn nhất ở nhiều đế quốc. Trong khi đó, hoạt động thương mại dọc theo tuyến xuyên Sahara phát triển mạnh.[86] Từ thế kỷ 15, hàng triệu người châu Phi bị bắt làm nô lệ và đưa sang châu Mỹ trong khuôn khổ cuộc buôn bán nô lệ Đại Tây Dương.[87] Phần lớn châu lục rơi vào ách đô hộ của các cường quốc châu Âu vào cuối thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20.[88] Trước làn sóng chủ nghĩa dân tộc, các nước châu Phi dần giành lại độc lập trong giai đoạn sau Thế chiến II, một thời kỳ chứng kiến tiến bộ kinh tế, tăng trưởng nhanh về dân số và đấu tranh vì ổn định chính trị.[89]

Giới sử học nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Á nhận thấy người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 100.000 năm trước.[90] Châu Á được xem là một trong những cái nôi của nền văn minh nhân loại với sự ra đời một số nền văn minh cổ đại đầu tiên ở Lưỡng Hà, lưu vực sông Ấn và Trung Quốc bắt đầu từ thiên niên kỷ thứ 4 và thứ 3 TCN.[91] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, các nền văn minh ở châu Á lục địa sản sinh ra tất cả các tôn giáo thế giới lớn và một số truyền thống triết học tiêu biểu như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Đạo giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo.[92] Khoảng thời gian này còn chứng kiến việc con đường tơ lụa được thành lập nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại và trao đổi văn hóa trên khắp lục địa Á-Âu, cùng với đó là sự hình thành các đế chế hùng mạnh như đế quốc Mông Cổ.[93] Ảnh hưởng của châu Âu dần gia tăng trong những thế kỷ tiếp theo, mở ra thời kỳ hiện đại, và đạt đỉnh vào thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20 khi nhiều khu vực của châu Á rơi vào ách cai trị thực dân đến khi Thế chiến II kết thúc.[94] Sau khi giành lại độc lập, các quốc gia châu Á bước vào giai đoạn hiện đại hóa với nền kinh tế và quy mô dân số tăng trưởng nhanh.[95]

Do tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến văn hóa và triết học phương Tây, Hy Lạp cổ đại là một đối tượng nghiên cứu quan trọng đối với các nhà sử học châu Âu.[96]
Trong nghiên cứu lịch sử châu Âu, các sử gia mô tả sự xuất hiện của những người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đầu tiên cách đây khoảng 45.000 năm.[97] Nhiều công trình nghiên cứu tập trung tìm hiểu những đóng góp quan trọng từ Hy Lạp cổ đại cho văn hóa, triết học và chính trị gắn liền với thế giới phương Tây vào thiên niên kỷ thứ nhất TCN,[96] cũng như cảm hứng từ di sản văn hóa của nền văn minh này đối với đế quốc La Mã và Đông La Mã.[98] Thời kỳ trung đại bắt đầu với việc đế quốc Tây La Mã sụp đổ vào thế kỷ 5 CN và được đánh dấu bởi làn sóng lan truyền Kitô giáo.[99] Từ thế kỷ 15, công cuộc khai phá và thuộc địa hóa từ châu Âu đã làm kết nối các châu lục lại với nhau, trong khi những bước tiến văn hóa, tri thức và khoa học thúc đẩy sự thay đổi của nhiều xã hội phương Tây.[100] Từ cuối thế kỷ 18 đến đầu thế kỷ 20, thế thống trị toàn cầu của châu Âu được củng cố bởi cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp và sự thành lập các thuộc địa lớn.[101] Thế thống trị đó chấm dứt do hậu quả thảm khốc của hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới.[102] Đến thời Chiến tranh Lạnh, châu lục bị chia cắt thành một khối phía Tây và một khối phía Đông. Cả hai khối cùng thúc đẩy hợp tác chính trị và kinh tế sâu rộng hơn sau khi Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc.[103]

Giới sử học khảo sát lịch sử châu Mỹ ghi nhận sự hiện diện những con người đầu tiên vào khoảng 20.000 đến 15.000 năm trước.[104] Châu Mỹ là cái nôi của vài trong số các nền văn minh sớm nhất như văn minh Norte Chico ở Nam Mỹ và văn minh Maya và Olmec ở Trung Mỹ.[105] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo chứng kiến sự xuất hiện nhiều đế chế lớn như Teotihuacan, Aztec và đế quốc Inca.[106] Sau khi người châu Âu gia nhập lục địa từ cuối thế kỷ 15, nhiều căn bệnh truyền nhiễm mới lan rộng dẫn đến dân số sụt giảm nghiêm trọng. Việc này cùng với quá trình thực dân hóa đã khiến các đế chế lớn sụp đổ và làm cấu trúc nhân khẩu học cũng như diện mạo văn hóa thay đổi toàn diện.[107] Các phong trào độc lập vào thế kỷ 18 và 19 dẫn đến việc hình thành những quốc gia mới trên khắp châu Mỹ.[108] Đến thế kỷ 20, Mỹ vươn lên trở thành cường quốc toàn cầu và đóng vai trò nổi bật trong cục diện Chiến tranh Lạnh.[109]

Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Đại Dương, các sử gia nhận định con người đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 60.000 đến 50.000 năm trước.[110] Quá trình phát triển các xã hội và nền văn hóa khu vực đa dạng được ghi nhận đầu tiên ở Úc và Papua New Guinea, sau mới đến các đảo khác thuộc Thái Bình Dương.[111] Sự gia nhập của người châu Âu vào thế kỷ 16 mang đến nhiều biến đổi sâu sắc, và đến cuối thế kỷ 19 phần lớn khu vực đã bị các nước phương Tây kiểm soát.[112] Châu Đại Dương đã tham gia nhiều cuộc xung đột trong hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới và trải qua giai đoạn phi thực dân hóa trong thời hậu chiến.[113]

Theo đề tài
Giới sử học thường giới hạn phạm vi khảo cứu về một chủ đề cụ thể.[114] Một số học giả đề xuất phân chia tổng quát thành ba đề tài chính: lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử kinh tế và lịch sử xã hội. Tuy nhiên, ranh giới giữa các phân nhánh này là mơ hồ và quan hệ giữa chúng với các phân nhánh đề tài khác như lịch sử trí thức không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng.[115]

Lịch sử chính trị nghiên cứu tổ chức quyền lực trong xã hội, tìm hiểu cách thức ra đời, phát triển và tác động qua lại của các cấu trúc quyền lực. Nhà nước hoặc các cấu trúc tương tự nhà nước là đối tượng trọng tâm của lĩnh vực nghiên cứu này xuyên suốt phần lớn lịch sử được ghi chép. Lịch sử chính trị phân tích cơ chế tổ chức nội bộ của một quốc gia, ví dụ như bè phái, đảng phái, tầng lớp lãnh đạo và các thể chế chính trị khác. Phân nhánh này còn nghiên cứu về việc hoạch định và thực thi chính sách cũng như quan hệ giữa nhà nước với các quốc gia khác.[116] Lịch sử chính trị là một trong những phân nhánh lâu đời nhất của lịch sử do đã được các sử gia như Herodotos và Thucydides nghiên cứu từ thời cổ đại, trong khi các lĩnh vực con tiêu biểu khác chỉ mới được công nhận là phân nhánh độc lập vào thế kỷ trước.[117]

Lịch sử quân sự nghiên cứu về xung đột vũ trang, bao gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ quân sự như máy bắn đá.[118]
Lịch sử ngoại giao và lịch sử quân sự có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử chính trị. Lịch sử ngoại giao khảo sát quan hệ quốc tế giữa các quốc gia, bao gồm những vấn đề liên quan đến chính sách đối ngoại như đàm phán, toan tính chiến lược, hiệp ước và xung đột giữa các nước cũng như vai trò của các tổ chức quốc tế trong những quy trình này.[119] Lịch sử quân sự phân tích sự hình thành, phát triển và tác động của các cuộc xung đột vũ trang trong lịch sử thế giới. Phạm vi nghiên cứu của lịch sử quân sự bao gồm phân tích về các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như tìm hiểu một trận chiến hay nguyên nhân gây ra một cuộc chiến tranh. Lịch sử quân sự còn xem xét tổng quan về sự phát triển của chiến tranh, trong đó gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ, chiến lược, chiến thuật, hậu cần và thể chế quân sự.[120]

Lịch sử kinh tế nghiên cứu cách thức sản xuất, trao đổi và tiêu thụ hàng hóa. Lĩnh vực này bao quát những khía cạnh kinh tế như sử dụng đất, lao động và tư bản, cung và cầu hàng hóa, chi phí và tư liệu sản xuất, phân phối thu nhập và của cải. Các nhà sử học kinh tế thường chú trọng phân tích những xu hướng chung mang tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như lạm phát, hơn là hành động và quyết định của cá nhân. Nếu có đủ dữ liệu, họ thường sử dụng các phương pháp định lượng như phân tích thống kê. Ở những giai đoạn trước thời kỳ hiện đại, dữ liệu có sẵn thường bị hạn chế, buộc giới sử học kinh tế phải phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tài liệu khan hiếm và ngoại suy thông tin từ chúng.[121]

Lịch sử xã hội là một lĩnh vực rộng lớn chuyên nghiên cứu những hiện tượng xã hội, song định nghĩa chính xác của nó chưa có sự thống nhất. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem đây là ngành nghiên cứu về cuộc sống thường ngày ngoài phạm vi chính trị và kinh tế, bao gồm tập quán văn hóa, cấu trúc gia đình, quan hệ cộng đồng và giáo dục. Một hướng tiếp cận mật thiết chú trọng nhiều hơn vào khám phá kinh nghiệm từ các nhóm xã hội cụ thể như giai cấp, chủng tộc, giới tính hoặc nhóm tuổi đối với thế giới mình đang sinh sống. Các cách hiểu khác coi lịch sử xã hội là nghiên cứu về những vấn đề xã hội như đói nghèo, bệnh tật và tội phạm, hoặc mở rộng phạm vi để xem xét sự phát triển của toàn thể xã hội nói chung.[122] Một số lĩnh vực có liên hệ gần gũi với lịch sử xã hội bao gồm lịch sử văn hóa, lịch sử giới tính và lịch sử tôn giáo.[123]

Lịch sử trí thức là lịch sử về tư tưởng, chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình phát triển của các khái niệm, triết lý và ý thức hệ. Nhánh này đặc biệt quan tâm đến các lĩnh vực học thuật nhưng mặt khác còn bao gồm nghiên cứu về tín ngưỡng và định kiến trong đời sống của con người bình thường. Bên cạnh việc tìm hiểu các phong trào trí thức, lịch sử trí thức còn khảo sát bối cảnh văn hóa và xã hội đã góp phần định hình nên những phong trào đó cũng như ảnh hưởng từ chúng đối với các tiến trình lịch sử khác.[124] Là hai trong những lĩnh vực liên quan mật thiết, lịch sử triết học phân tích sự phát triển của tư tưởng triết lý[125] còn lịch sử khoa học nghiên cứu quá trình biến đổi của lý thuyết và thực tiễn khoa học, chẳng hạn như những đóng góp khoa học của Charles Darwin và Albert Einstein.[126] Lịch sử học nghệ thuật là một bộ môn khác có liên hệ với lịch sử trí thức, chuyên suy xét các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trong lịch sử cùng với sự phát triển của các hình thức, phong cách và trào lưu nghệ thuật. Lịch sử học nghệ thuật bao gồm bàn luận về bối cảnh văn hóa, xã hội và chính trị của sáng tạo nghệ thuật.[127]

Lịch sử môi trường nghiên cứu quan hệ giữa con người và môi trường sống, hướng đến am hiểu cách mà loài người và phần còn lại của tự nhiên tác động lẫn nhau trong chiều dài lịch sử.[128] Một số phân nhánh khác theo đề tài bao gồm lịch sử hiến pháp, lịch sử luật pháp, lịch sử đô thị, lịch sử kinh doanh, lịch sử công nghệ, lịch sử y học, lịch sử giáo dục và lịch sử dân tộc.[129]

Lĩnh vực khác
Một số phân nhánh của lịch sử được đặc trưng bởi phương pháp mà chúng áp dụng. Chẳng hạn, lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử phụ thuộc lần lượt vào các phương pháp định lượng và phương tiện truyền thông kỹ thuật số trong nghiên cứu.[130] Lịch sử so sánh đối chiếu các hiện tượng lịch sử thuộc những thời kỳ, khu vực hoặc nền văn hóa phân biệt để xem xét những điểm giống và khác nhau giữa chúng.[131] Không giống như hầu hết phân nhánh khác, lịch sử truyền miệng dựa vào lời kể thay vì tài liệu ghi chép, bao hàm tường thuật nhân chứng, chứng cứ nghe nói lại và truyền thuyết cộng đồng. Lịch sử truyền miệng phản ánh kinh nghiệm cá nhân, sự diễn giải và trí nhớ của những người dân thường, cho thấy tính chủ quan trong cách con người ghi nhớ lịch sử.[132] Lịch sử phản thực tế sử dụng tư duy phản thực tế để khảo sát những hướng đi khác của lịch sử và khám phá những gì có thể sẽ xảy ra dưới những điều kiện khác nhau.[133] Một vài phân nhánh nhất định của lịch sử được tách bạch dựa trên quan điểm lý thuyết, ví dụ như lịch sử Mác-xít và lịch sử nữ quyền.[134]

An old double-hemisphere map of the world
Lịch sử thế giới nghiên cứu lịch sử ở cấp độ toàn cầu, kết hợp với toàn bộ lịch sử loài người.[135]
Một số cách phân chia lĩnh vực tập trung vào tầm vực của đề tài nghiên cứu. Lịch sử Vĩ đại là nhánh có tầm vực rộng nhất, bao hàm mọi thứ từ Vụ Nổ Lớn cho đến hiện tại, kết hợp các yếu tố của vũ trụ học, địa chất học, sinh học và nhân loại học.[9] Lịch sử thế giới là một phân nhánh khác với phạm vi rộng, khảo sát toàn thể lịch sử loài người bắt đầu từ sự tiến hóa của các loài giống người.[135] Các thuật ngữ lịch sử vĩ mô hay lịch sử vi mô chỉ những cấp độ quy mô phân tích khác nhau, dao động từ các quy luật mang tính toàn cầu đến nghiên cứu chi tiết về bối cảnh địa phương, cộng đồng nhỏ, gia đình, cá nhân hoặc sự kiện cụ thể.[136] Có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử vi mô là thể loại tiểu sử lịch sử, chuyên thuật lại cuộc đời của một cá nhân trong bối cảnh thời đại và di sản mà nhân vật để lại.[137]

Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm các hoạt động nhằm trình bày lịch sử đến công chúng. Việc này thường diễn ra bên ngoài phạm vi học thuật truyền thống ở những bối cảnh như bảo tàng, di tích lịch sử, du lịch di sản và truyền thông đại chúng.[138]

Quá trình phát triển của bộ môn
Trước khi có chữ viết, tri thức lịch sử được lưu truyền chủ yếu qua truyền miệng.[139] Những bản ghi chép lịch sử sớm nhất thường đan xen giữa các sự kiện có thật với yếu tố thần thoại, chẳng hạn như Sử thi Gilgamesh từ Lưỡng Hà cổ đại và Odyssey, một tác phẩm của Hy Lạp cổ đại được cho là do Homeros sáng tác.[140] Xuất bản vào thế kỷ 5 TCN, cuốn Lịch sử của Herodotos[o] là một trong những công trình nền tảng của truyền thống sử học phương Tây, trong đó tác giả chú trọng vào khảo cứu dựa trên lý tính và bằng chứng thay vì những câu chuyện của Homeros và các thi sĩ khác.[142] Thucydides kế thừa và phát triển phương pháp của Herodotos nhưng tập trung nhiều hơn vào các tiến trình phát triển chính trị và quân sự cụ thể, trái ngược với phạm vi rộng cùng các yếu tố dân tộc chí trong tác phẩm của Herodotos.[143] Sử luận La Mã chịu ảnh hưởng lớn từ truyền thống Hy Lạp, kết hợp giữa việc ghi chép sự kiện và phán xét đạo đức về các nhân vật lịch sử.[p] Các sử gia La Mã thời kỳ đầu sử dụng phong cách biên niên sử, sắp xếp các sự kiện theo từng năm và hầu như không bình luận gì thêm, còn những tác giả về sau ưu tiên nhiều hơn vào tường thuật và phân tích.[145]

Sử ký của Tư Mã Thiên là một trong những tự sự lịch sử công phu ra đời sớm nhất về lịch sử Trung Quốc và thế giới theo hiểu biết của người Trung Hoa.[146]
Một truyền thống chép sử lớn khác ra đời tại Trung Quốc cổ đại với các tiền thân đầu tiên xuất hiện vào cuối thiên niên kỷ thứ 2 TCN. Truyền thống đó xem biên niên sử là hình thái cao nhất của ghi chép lịch sử và đề cao việc kiểm chứng dựa trên sử liệu. Tập quán này gắn liền với triết lý Nho gia và có liên hệ chặt chẽ với bộ máy chính quyền dưới hình thức triều đại cầm quyền. Các sử gia Trung Hoa đã phát triển một phương pháp chép sử mạch lạc và có hệ thống sớm hơn so với những nơi khác.[147] Công trình của Tư Mã Thiên có ảnh hưởng đặc biệt; phương pháp nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ cùng việc thêm thắt những quan điểm khác với chính thống từ ông đã định hình nên hệ tiêu chuẩn cho sử luận về sau.[148] Ở Ấn Độ cổ đại, tự sự lịch sử có sự gắn bó mật thiết với tôn giáo. Chúng thường kết hợp sự kiện có thật với các yếu tố siêu nhiên, điển hình như trong Mahabharata.[149]

Tại châu Âu thời trung đại, lịch sử chủ yếu được giáo sĩ ghi lại dưới hình thức biên niên sử. Giới sử gia Kitô giáo lấy truyền thống Hy-La và Do Thái làm cảm hứng để tường thuật lại quá khứ như một phần trong kế hoạch thiêng liêng do Chúa định sẵn.[150] Những nhân vật tiêu biểu góp phần làm nên tập quán này gồm sử gia Eusebius và Bêđa cùng nhà thần học Augustinô thành Hippo.[151] Ở thế giới Hồi giáo, chép sử cũng chịu ảnh hưởng tương tự từ tôn giáo, lấy góc nhìn Hồi giáo để diễn giải quá khứ. Sử luận Hồi giáo nhấn mạnh vào chuỗi truyền tin để bảo đảm độ tin cậy của tự sự lịch sử.[152] Al-Tabari là tác giả của một bộ sử ký công phu, kéo dài từ thuở khai thiên lập địa đến thời đại đương thời với ông. Ibn Khaldun phản tư các vấn đề nền tảng của chép sử về mặt triết lý, ví dụ như những quy luật phổ quát chi phối các tiến trình lịch sử cũng như giới hạn của chân lý lịch sử.[153]

Vào thời nhà Đường (618–907 CN) tại Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử ngày càng được thể chế hóa sâu hơn khi một cơ quan chuyên trách được thành lập năm 629 CN. Cơ quan này đã giám sát công tác biên soạn thực lục, những bộ ghi chép chi tiết làm nền tảng cho bộ chính sử quốc gia. Giới sử gia nhà Đường đề cao sự khác biệt giữa bản thân các sự kiện đã xảy ra và cách mà chúng được phản ánh trong các văn bản lịch sử.[154] Chép sử thời nhà Tống (960–1279 CN) diễn ra qua nhiều thể loại như bách khoa thư, tiểu sử và tiểu thuyết lịch sử, đồng thời lịch sử cũng trở thành một môn học chính trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc.[155] Tại Nhật Bản, một truyền thống chép sử riêng bắt đầu hình thành vào thế kỷ 8 CN, chịu ảnh hưởng từ mô hình Trung Hoa. Tương tự như ở Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử tại đây gắn bó mật thiết với hoàng thất nhưng các nhà sử học Nhật Bản ít chú trọng hơn vào đánh giá phê phán sử liệu.[156]

Đến thời Phục Hưng và cận đại (khoảng năm 1500 đến 1800), các truyền thống sử học dần trở nên gắn kết và ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau.[157] Từ thế kỷ 14 ở châu Âu, phong trào Phục Hưng đã đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ quan điểm tôn giáo đặc trưng của thời Trung Cổ sang mối quan tâm mới đối với di sản cổ điển Hy Lạp và La Mã. Các nhà nhân văn Phục Hưng sử dụng phương pháp phê phán sử liệu tinh vi nhằm xem xét lại những tác phẩm sử ký tôn giáo trước đây, qua đó góp phần thúc đẩy quá trình thế tục hóa trong ghi chép lịch sử. Từ thế kỷ 15 đến 17, giới sử học nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào vai trò mô phạm của lịch sử và sử dụng lịch sử như một công cụ để củng cố trật tự xã hội hiện có hoặc phục hồi lý tưởng về quá khứ. Khi máy in ép được phát minh, tài liệu viết trở nên dễ tiếp cận với chi phí phải chăng và việc tiếp nhận tri thức lịch sử dần được mở rộng ra bên ngoài giới giáo sĩ và quý tộc. Cùng lúc đó, tư tưởng hướng kinh nghiệm gắn với cuộc cách mạng khoa học đã làm dấy lên hoài nghi về khả năng đạt tới chân lý lịch sử phổ quát.[158] Trong thời kỳ Khai Sáng vào thế kỷ 18, ghi chép lịch sử chịu tác động mạnh mẽ từ chủ nghĩa duy lý và chủ nghĩa hoài nghi. Thời gian này, các nhà sử học tìm cách khai phá những quy luật và ý nghĩa sâu xa trong tiến trình lịch sử với mục đích thách thức quyền lực và giáo điều truyền thống bằng lý trí và phương pháp thực nghiệm. Ngoài ra, phạm vi của nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng được mở rộng thêm và tập trung ngày càng nhiều vào các đề tài xã hội và kinh tế cũng như so sánh các nền văn hóa khác nhau.[159]

Ở Trung Quốc thời nhà Minh (1368–1644), sự quan tâm của công chúng đối với các ấn phẩm ghi chép lịch sử gia tăng rõ rệt. Bên cạnh những công trình do sử quan biên soạn để tiếp nối thực lục của các triều đại trước, nhiều tác phẩm phi chính thức của các học giả tư nhân cũng phát triển mạnh. Những học giả này thường thể hiện phong cách sáng tạo hơn và đôi khi đưa ra diễn giải và tường thuật khác với chính thống.[160] Tại thế giới Hồi giáo, nhiều tập quán chép sử mới ra đời tại đế quốc Safavid, Mogul và Ottoman.[161] Trong khi đó tại châu Mỹ, các nhà thám hiểm châu Âu bắt đầu ghi lại và lý giải những tường thuật lịch sử của các dân tộc bản địa. Những câu chuyện này vốn được lưu truyền qua hình thức truyền miệng hoặc ký hiệu tượng hình và thường mang đến cách nhìn khác biệt so với quan điểm lịch sử của châu Âu đương thời.[162]

Leopold von Ranke đã cách mạng hóa tiêu chuẩn học thuật lịch sử nhờ cho ra đời quy trình đánh giá sử liệu sơ cấp kỹ lưỡng.[163]
Ghi chép lịch sử có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng chuyên nghiệp hóa và khoa học hóa vào thế kỷ 19. Sau công trình của Leopold von Ranke, một phương pháp phê phán sử liệu có hệ thống được thừa nhận rộng rãi và nhiều cơ sở học thuật chuyên về lịch sử như khoa ngành đại học, hiệp hội chuyên môn và tạp chí được thành lập.[164] Cùng với tinh thần khoa học của thời đại, Auguste Comte phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng và đặt ra mục tiêu khám phá những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử tương tự như với các định luật trong tự nhiên.[165] Dựa trên triết lý của Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx đã đề xuất một quy luật chung như vậy trong lý thuyết về chủ nghĩa duy vật lịch sử, cho rằng lực lượng kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp là nguyên nhân cơ bản dẫn đến thay đổi lịch sử.[166] Một bước phát triển quan trọng khác trong giai đoạn này là sự lan tỏa của các phương pháp sử luận châu Âu, vốn dần trở thành hướng tiếp cận chủ đạo trong nghiên cứu học thuật về quá khứ trên thế giới.[167]

Trong thế kỷ 20, những giả định và phương pháp lịch sử truyền thống dần bị đặt nghi vấn, còn tầm vực của nghiên cứu lịch sử tiếp tục được mở rộng.[168] Trường phái Annales kết hợp tri thức về xã hội học, tâm lý học và kinh tế học để nghiên cứu các tiến trình dài hạn.[169] Các chế độ chuyên chế như Đức Quốc Xã, Liên Xô và Trung Quốc thao túng tự sự lịch sử vì mục đích ý thức hệ.[170] Nhiều sử gia lựa chọn nghiên cứu với góc nhìn độc đáo, tập trung vào kinh nghiệm của các nhóm thiểu số xã hội qua những hướng tiếp cận như lịch sử từ dưới lên, lịch sử vi mô, lịch sử truyền miệng và sử học nữ quyền.[171] Chủ nghĩa hậu thực dân tìm cách phê phán và làm suy yếu sự bá chủ của cách tiếp cận phương Tây, còn chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại bác bỏ luận điểm về sự tồn tại một chân lý lịch sử phổ quát duy nhất.[172] Giới sử học trí thức khảo sát quá trình phát triển của các hệ tư tưởng trong lịch sử.[173] Đến nửa sau của thế kỷ, những nỗ lực mới trong biên soạn lịch sử thế giới với quy mô toàn cầu đã thu hút nhiều sự chú ý, trong khi các thành tựu công nghệ trở thành động lực cho sự phát triển của lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử.[174]

Sử luận

Ibn Khaldun là một nhân vật tiêu biểu trong sử luận Hồi giáo.[175]
Sử luận là nghiên cứu về các phương pháp và sự phát triển của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Nhà sử luận suy xét cách thức mà sử gia tiến hành nghiên cứu và viết sử, dẫn đến đây là một siêu lý thuyết dưới dạng lịch sử của lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ sử luận theo nghĩa khác để chỉ tường thuật được ghi chép về quá khứ.[176]

Một chủ đề cốt lõi trong sử luận dưới góc độ siêu lý thuyết tập trung vào chuẩn mực của bằng chứng và luận cứ trong khảo cứu lịch sử. Giới sử luận nghiên cứu và hệ thống hóa cách thức sử gia sử dụng tư liệu để xây dựng nên tự sự về quá khứ, trong đó có việc phân tích những giả thiết lý giải làm cơ sở cho quá trình xây dựng tự sự. Một số vấn đề khác có liên quan bao gồm văn phong và thủ pháp tu từ được trình bày trong các tác phẩm lịch sử.[177]

Qua việc so sánh công trình của các sử gia, giới sử luận có thể xác định trường phái tư tưởng dựa trên phương pháp nghiên cứu, giả định và phong cách chung.[178] Chẳng hạn, nhà sử luận khảo sát đặc trưng của trường phái Annales như việc sử dụng dữ liệu định lượng từ nhiều bộ môn hay mối quan tâm chủ yếu đến các quá trình kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn.[179] Sự so sánh còn mở rộng cho toàn thể thời kỳ từ cổ đại đến hiện đại. Bằng cách này, nhà sử luận có thể vạch ra tiến trình phát triển của lịch sử với tư cách một môn học thuật, từ đó cho thấy các phương pháp, đề tài và mục tiêu nghiên cứu chủ đạo đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.[180]

Triết học lịch sử
Bài chi tiết: Triết học lịch sử
Triết học lịch sử[q] suy xét những nền tảng lý thuyết của lịch sử. Bộ môn này quan tâm cả về bản thân quá khứ như là một chuỗi các sự kiện liên kết lẫn nhau và về lĩnh vực học thuật chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình đó. Những hiểu biết và cách tiếp cận từ một số phân nhánh triết học khác như siêu hình học, tri thức luận, thông diễn học và luân lý học có ảnh hưởng nhất định đến triết học lịch sử.[182]

Khi suy xét quá trình lịch sử, triết gia khám phá những thực thể cơ bản làm nên các hiện tượng lịch sử. Một số cách tiếp cận phụ thuộc chủ yếu vào niềm tin và hành động của cá nhân còn số khác bao hàm cả tập thể và các thực thể chung khác như văn minh, thiết chế, ý thức hệ và lực lượng xã hội.[183] Một chủ đề liên quan quan tâm bản chất của các cơ chế nhân quả liên kết những sự kiện lịch sử với nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng.[184] Một quan điểm cho rằng có những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử để xác định hướng tiếp diễn của sự kiện, tương tự như các định luật trong khoa học tự nhiên. Theo một góc nhìn khác, quan hệ nhân quả giữa các sự kiện lịch sử là duy nhất và được định hình bởi những yếu tố tùy cơ.[185] Trước đây, một số nhà triết học đã đưa ra luận cứ rằng hướng đi tổng quát của chiều dài lịch sử luôn tuân theo những quy luật lớn. Theo một luận điểm, lịch sử có tính tuần hoàn, tức là ở quy mô đủ lớn thì các sự kiện riêng lẻ hoặc xu hướng chung luôn lặp lại theo chu kỳ. Một lý thuyết khác khẳng định lịch sử là một quy trình tuyến tính có mục đích, đang chuyển động tới một mục tiêu xác định trước.[186][r]

Các chủ đề triết học lịch sử và sử luận có điểm tương đồng do chúng cùng quan tâm đến tiêu chuẩn của lý luận lịch sử. Nhà sử luận thường tập trung nhiều vào mô tả các phương pháp và tiến trình phát triển cụ thể trong nghiên cứu lịch sử. Trái lại, nhà triết học lịch sử có thiên hướng khám phá những quy luật tổng quát hơn, bao gồm đặt ra những câu hỏi đánh giá về việc phương pháp và giả thiết nào là đúng đắn.[188] Lý luận lịch sử đôi khi được vận dụng làm phương pháp giải thích hiện tượng trong triết học và các bộ môn khác. Phương pháp này, vốn hay gọi là chủ nghĩa lịch sử, lập luận rằng hiểu biết về một sự vật hay hiện tượng nào đó đòi hỏi phải nắm được bối cảnh lịch sử đặc thù hoặc quá trình tiến hóa của nó. Ví dụ, chủ nghĩa lịch sử về chân lý cho rằng chân lý phụ thuộc vào hoàn cảnh lịch sử, tức là không thể tồn tại chân lý xuyên lịch sử. Chủ nghĩa lịch sử tương phản với các hướng tiếp cận tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết vượt thời gian và phổ quát về chủ thể.[189]

Khách quan lịch sử
Nhiều tranh cãi trong triết học lịch sử xoay quanh khả năng tồn tại một tường thuật khách quan về lịch sử. Nhiều nhà lý thuyết nhận định lý tưởng đó là không thể đạt được và chỉ ra nguyên nhân nằm ở bản chất chủ quan trong cách lý giải sự kiện, khía cạnh tự sự của lịch sử cũng như ảnh hưởng của giá trị và thiên kiến cá nhân trong quan điểm và hành động của các nhân vật lịch sử và nhà sử học. Theo một góc nhìn, một số dữ kiện nhất định có tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như dữ kiện về thời điểm xảy ra hạn hán hoặc quân đội nào bị đánh bại. Song, góc nhìn này không đảm bảo tính khách quan tổng quát do sử gia vẫn phải lý giải và tổng hợp dữ kiện để đi đến một tự sự chung phản ánh các xu hướng và tiến trình phát triển lớn.[190] Vì vậy, một số nhà sử học như G. M. Trevelyan và Keith Jenkins đã khẳng định toàn bộ lịch sử đều có thiên kiến và cho rằng tự sự lịch sử không thể tách rời khỏi những giả định chủ quan và phán xét giá trị.[191]

Một số cách nhìn gắn với chủ nghĩa duy thực, chủ nghĩa kinh nghiệm và chủ nghĩa tái thiết[192] xem lịch sử là sự tìm kiếm chân lý hoặc tri thức, những gì mà chúng xem là có thể phục dựng được qua việc đánh giá nghiêm ngặt và diễn giải cẩn trọng các bằng chứng.[193][s] Nhiều học giả khác phê phán quan điểm đó, nhấn mạnh vào bản chất chủ quan và thiên vị của tri thức lịch sử.[t] Những nhà chủ nghĩa quan điểm cho rằng quan điểm lịch sử vốn dĩ đã có tính chủ quan do đòi hỏi phải chọn lọc sử liệu hay nghiên cứu cụ thể và xác định thông tin nào có thể coi là sự thật lịch sử. Họ lập luận mọi phát biểu chỉ có thể mang tính khách quan trong phạm vi nội tại hoặc khi xét tương đối với một trong nhiều góc nhìn lịch sử cạnh tranh lẫn nhau.[198] Một cách nhìn theo chủ nghĩa hoài nghi hoặc thuyết tương đối cực đoan hơn còn khẳng định không có tri thức lịch sử nào có thể được chứng tỏ là khách quan.[199][u] Sự nhấn mạnh về tính chủ quan đó đã được mở rộng trong các lý thuyết hậu hiện đại, vốn nhận định con người không thể nhận thức quá khứ một cách khách quan bởi ý nghĩa của lịch sử thực chất được kiến tạo qua văn bản do con người sáng tạo ra với ngôn ngữ "cấu thành nên thế giới theo cách mà chúng ta nhận thức nó".[201][v] Đáp lại xu hướng trên, các nhà tân duy thực khẳng định lại vai trò trung tâm của phương pháp luận kinh nghiệm trong phân tích lịch sử. Họ thừa nhận sức ảnh hưởng của đánh giá chủ quan nhưng tin rằng chân lý lịch sử vẫn có khả năng đạt tới được.[203][w]

Giáo dục

Lịch sử là môn bắt buộc tại trường học ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204]
Lịch sử là một bộ phận trong chương trình học tại trường phổ thông ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204] Giáo dục lịch sử giai đoạn đầu hướng tới khơi dậy sự hứng thú cho học sinh về quá khứ và giúp học sinh làm quen với các khái niệm cơ bản của tư tưởng lịch sử. Bằng việc xây dựng nhận thức lịch sử nền tảng, môn lịch sử hướng đến nuôi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc cá nhân và cộng đồng trên cơ sở hiểu biết về nguồn gốc văn hóa.[205] Môn học thường đi theo hình thức tự sự qua việc trình bày những câu chuyện đơn giản, tập trung vào các nhân vật lịch sử hoặc nguồn gốc của ngày lễ, lễ hội và tập quán địa phương.[206] Giáo dục lịch sử nâng cao ở trường trung học bao hàm phạm vi đề tài rộng hơn, từ lịch sử cổ đại đến hiện đại ở cả cấp độ địa phương và toàn cầu. Giai đoạn giáo dục này còn nhằm giúp học sinh làm quen với các phương pháp nghiên cứu lịch sử, bao gồm năng lực lý giải và đánh giá phê phán luận điểm lịch sử.[207]

Có nhiều phương pháp giảng dạy được giáo viên lịch sử áp dụng, bao gồm thuyết trình về các tiến trình phát triển lịch sử, đặt câu hỏi để tạo sự tương tác và kích thích tư duy phản biện, hoặc tổ chức thảo luận nhóm về các đề tài lịch sử. Học sinh làm việc trực tiếp với sử liệu để học cách phân tích và lý giải bằng chứng ở cả hình thức cá nhân và làm việc nhóm. Các em cũng tham gia ghi chép lịch sử để phát triển kỹ năng liên kết tư duy một cách rõ ràng và thuyết phục. Đánh giá qua kiểm tra viết hoặc vấn đáp được thực hiện nhằm đảm bảo đạt được các mục tiêu của môn học.[208] Phương pháp truyền thống trong giáo dục lịch sử thường là trình bày nhiều dữ kiện như ngày xảy ra sự kiện lớn và tên tuổi của các nhân vật lịch sử mà học sinh phải ghi nhớ. Ngược lại, một số cách tiếp cận hiện đại chú trọng khuyến khích tương tác tích cực và hiểu biết liên ngành sâu hơn về các quy luật tổng quát, tập trung vào cả những gì đã xảy ra, vì sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng đối với hiện tại.[209]

Giáo dục lịch sử ở trường công lập phục vụ nhiều mục đích. Một kỹ năng cốt lõi mà môn này hướng đến là năng lực lịch sử, tức khả năng lĩnh hội, phân tích phê phán và phản ứng trước diễn giải lịch sử. Bằng nhận thức về các tiến trình phát triển lớn trong quá khứ, học sinh có thể làm quen với nhiều bối cảnh của đời sống con người, từ đó hiểu rõ hơn thời đại mà mình đang sống cùng với các nền văn hóa đa dạng. Giáo dục lịch sử còn nhằm bồi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc văn hóa qua việc kết nối học sinh với các di sản, truyền thống và phong tục tập quán, chẳng hạn như giới thiệu về những yếu tố biểu tượng gồm di tích, tượng đài, nhân vật lịch sử và lễ hội.[210] Hiểu biết về quá khứ chung và di sản văn hóa có khả năng đóng góp cho sự hình thành bản sắc dân tộc và giúp học sinh sẵn sàng trở thành công dân tích cực. Khía cạnh chính trị này của giáo dục lịch sử có thể dẫn đến tranh cãi về việc nên đưa những chủ đề nào vào sách giáo khoa phổ thông và thậm chí đã từng gây ra cái gọi là chiến luận về lịch sử đối với chương trình học ở một số khu vực.[211] Yếu tố chính trị có khả năng làm các đề tài nhạy cảm bị diễn giải theo hướng thiên lệch nhằm củng cố hình ảnh di sản quốc gia một cách tích cực hơn so với thực tế.[212][x]

Ảnh chụp phòng trưng bày bảo tàng thể hiện bộ sưu tập hiện vật lịch sử
Giáo dục không chính quy qua triển lãm tạo tác lịch sử tại các bảo tàng là một bộ phận của lịch sử đại chúng.[214]
Ngoài giáo dục chính quy trong nhà trường, lịch sử còn được giảng dạy theo hình thức không chính quy ngoài lớp học. Lịch sử đại chúng được thể hiện tại những nơi như bảo tàng và khu tưởng niệm, trong đó thường chọn lọc một số hiện vật để chuyển tải những câu chuyện lịch sử cụ thể.[214] Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm lịch sử phổ biến, vốn có mục tiêu làm cho quá khứ trở nên hấp dẫn và dễ tiếp cận đến đối tượng khán giả rộng rãi và không chuyên trong các phương tiện truyền thông như sách, chương trình truyền hình hay nội dung trực tuyến.[215] Một phương tiện giáo dục lịch sử không chính quy khác là truyền thống truyền miệng với sự lưu truyền những tự sự về quá khứ qua nhiều thế hệ.[216]

Các lĩnh vực khác
Lịch sử sử dụng một phương pháp luận liên ngành dựa trên những phát kiến từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, địa chất học, di truyền học, nhân loại học và ngôn ngữ học.[217][y] Khảo cổ học nghiên cứu những tạo tác lịch sử do con người chế tạo và các hình thức văn hóa vật thể khác. Những phát hiện của giới khảo cổ mang lại hiểu biết quan trọng về các hoạt động của con người và quá trình phát triển văn hóa trong quá khứ.[219] Sự diễn giải bằng chứng khảo cổ đặt ra những thách thức riêng, khác biệt so với việc phân tích nhóm tác phẩm lịch sử thông thường ghi chép bằng chữ viết. Điều này đồng thời cũng mở ra những cơ hội mới từ việc trình bày thông tin chưa được ghi chép, cho phép sử gia tiếp cận quá khứ của những xã hội chưa có chữ viết và các nhóm thiểu số trong xã hội có chữ viết qua sự nghiên cứu di tích văn hóa vật chất. Trước khi khảo cổ học hiện đại xuất hiện vào thế kỷ 19, nghiên cứu đồ cổ là nền tảng ban đầu của bộ môn này và đóng vai trò chủ yếu trong bảo tồn tạo tác lịch sử.[220]

Địa chất học và các môn khoa học Trái Đất khác giúp sử gia hiểu được bối cảnh môi trường và các quá trình vật lý ảnh hưởng đến xã hội trong quá khứ, bao gồm điều kiện khí hậu, cảnh quan và hiện tượng tự nhiên.[221] Di truyền học cung cấp thông tin then chốt về nguồn gốc tiến hóa của loài người, di dân, tổ tiên và biến đổi nhân khẩu học.[222] Nhân loại học tìm hiểu văn hóa và hành vi của con người với các khía cạnh như cơ cấu xã hội, hệ tín ngưỡng và thực hành nghi lễ, mang đến cơ sở tri thức cho việc lý giải sự kiện lịch sử.[223] Ngôn ngữ học lịch sử nghiên cứu sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ theo thời gian, có vai trò cần thiết khi cần diễn giải văn bản cổ đại và đồng thời cũng cung cấp thông tin về quy luật di dân và trao đổi văn hóa.[224] Giới sử học còn sử dụng bằng chứng từ các lĩnh vực khác thuộc khoa học vật lý, khoa học sinh học và khoa học xã hội cùng với nhân văn học.[225]

Do có liên quan đến ý thức hệ và bản sắc dân tộc, lịch sử có quan hệ gần gũi với chính trị và những lý thuyết lịch sử có thể tác động trực tiếp đến quyết định chính trị. Chẳng hạn, việc một nước cố gắng sáp nhập lãnh thổ của nước khác theo chủ nghĩa phục hồi lãnh thổ thường có nguyên nhân nằm ở các lý thuyết lịch sử cho rằng vùng lãnh thổ tranh chấp đó thuộc về nước đầu tiên trong quá khứ.[226] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò trọng tâm ở cái gọi là tôn giáo lịch sử, vốn đặt nền tảng giáo lý của mình trên những sự kiện lịch sử. Ví dụ, Kitô giáo thường được phân loại là tôn giáo lịch sử do tập trung vào các sự kiện xoay quanh Chúa Giê-su.[227] Lịch sử còn có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực khác thông qua nghiên cứu về quá khứ của chính những lĩnh vực đó như lịch sử khoa học, toán học, triết học và nghệ thuật.[228]

^ Một số nhà lý thuyết xác định thời sơ sử là một giai đoạn riêng biệt sau thời tiền sử, kéo dài từ lúc chữ viết được phát minh đến khi xuất hiện những bản chép sử đầu tiên.[6]
^ Lịch sử Vĩ đại (Big History) do nhà sử học David Christian xây dựng vào cuối thập niên 1980 có phạm vi trải dài đến Vụ Nổ Lớn, bao hàm sự phát triển vũ trụ và quá trình tiến hóa sinh học của sự sống bên cạnh lịch sử thế giới.[9]
^ Các sử gia thời kỳ đầu như Herodotos và Thucydides đã coi tự sự của Homeros cùng những nhà thơ khác là không tưởng và không chính xác.[14]
^ Một cách nhìn có liên quan là chủ nghĩa xét lại lịch sử, vốn nhằm lật lại những quan điểm đã được củng cố về lịch sử. Xét lại lịch sử gồm nhiều dạng, từ đưa ra bằng chứng và phương pháp mới chống lại tư duy hiện tại đến chỉ trích giá trị hoặc tầm quan trọng của các sự kiện hoặc nhân vật lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ chủ nghĩa xét lại theo nghĩa trung lập để chỉ bất kỳ sự bác bỏ hoặc diễn giải lại luận điểm chính thống. Số khác cho rằng thuật ngữ gắn với việc làm bỏ qua bằng chứng xác thực và kết hợp các quan niệm tương đối hoặc hoài nghi một cách cực đoan để biện minh góc nhìn ngụy sử, cố ý làm suy giảm uy tín của tri thức đã được khẳng định về các sự kiện lịch sử thông qua phê phán tri thức luận.[21]
^ Hiểu theo nghĩa hẹp, phương pháp lịch sử đôi khi chỉ bao gồm việc đánh giá hoặc phê phán sử liệu.[29]
^ Định nghĩa chính xác về nguồn sơ cấp và nguồn thứ cấp là vấn đề còn tranh cãi. Việc một nguồn tư liệu cụ thể được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp không phải lúc nào cũng có sự thống nhất. Ví dụ, trong trường hợp một người không xuất hiện trong một cuộc bạo loạn nhưng đưa tin về vụ việc đó ngay sau khi xảy ra, một số nhà sử học xem tin bài đó là nguồn sơ cấp còn số khác xem đó là nguồn thứ cấp.[37]
^ Quan niệm lấy đánh giá sử liệu làm trọng tâm của Leopold von Ranke có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến nghiên cứu lịch sử.[40]
^ Bối cảnh và thời điểm xuất bản tài liệu thường được xét đến để hiểu được nghĩa của các thuật ngữ mà tài liệu đang sử dụng. Chẳng hạn, nếu một tài liệu tiếng Anh dùng từ awful, sử gia phải xác định xem từ này thể hiện nghĩa hiện đại 'tồi tệ' hay nghĩa cũ 'đáng kinh ngạc'.[42]
^ Điều này trở nên đặc biệt khó khăn nếu các sử liệu khác nhau đưa ra thông tin dường như mâu thuẫn nhau.[44]
^ Sự sáng tạo và trí tưởng tượng cần có cho bước này là một trong những lý do khiến một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn nghệ thuật thay vì là một môn khoa học.[45]
^ Chẳng hạn, Martha Washington đốt toàn bộ thư từ giữa bà với chồng George Washington, để lại khoảng trống kéo dài hàng chục năm về mối quan hệ giữa hai người.[52] Sự tồn tại cấm kỵ (ví dụ như cấm kỵ đồng tính luyến ái) là một nguyên nhân khác gây ra khoảng trống, có thể dẫn đến hiện tượng có ít thông tin về chủ đề được ghi lại.[51] Thông lệ xóa tên người đã mất bị xem là kẻ thù khỏi ghi chép công khai được gọi là damnatio memoriae.[53]
^ Có nhiều bất đồng về thời điểm bắt đầu và kết thúc chính xác của mỗi thời kỳ. Các cách phân kỳ khác có thể lấy những khoảng thời gian chồng chéo nhau hoặc khác biệt nhiều so với thông thường.[64]
^ Những căn bệnh mới cùng với sự xâm lược và bóc lột quân sự từ châu Âu đã gây ra mất mát lớn về nhân mạng và dẫn đến sự gián đoạn văn hóa trong các cộng đồng bản địa ở châu Mỹ cũng như một số hậu quả nghiêm trọng khác.[74]
^ Nhấn mạnh mối quan hệ mật thiết giữa địa lý và lịch sử, Jules Michelet viết trong lời nói đầu cuốn Histoire de France năm 1869: "không có cơ sở địa lý, con người, những người làm nên lịch sử, dường như đang quá hạnh phúc".[80]
^ Herodotos thường được xem là "cha đẻ của lịch sử" nhưng cũng bị gọi là "cha đẻ của dối trá" bởi không phải mọi tự sự của ông đều đáng tin.[141]
^ Khía cạnh này cũng có thể thấy ở một mức độ nào đó trong những tác phẩm của các sử gia Hy Lạp như Herodotos và Polybius.[144]
^ Lý thuyết lịch sử là một thuật ngữ có liên hệ mật thiết đôi lúc được dùng làm từ đồng nghĩa.[181]
^ Một số triết gia có luận điểm tương tự như Francis Fukuyama rằng "hồi kết của lịch sử" đã đến dựa trên tuyên bố cho rằng quá trình tiến triển ý thức hệ của loài người đã đạt đến cực hạn.[187]
^ Nhà sử học người Đức Leopold von Ranke là một trong những người đề xướng quan trọng nhất của cách tiếp cận khoa học này vào thế kỷ 19.[194] Sir Geoffrey Elton, Arthur Marwick và E. P. Thompson là ba trong số những học giả thời hiện đại tán thành với góc nhìn trên.[193]
^ Những phê phán này dựa trên một số luận cứ như: việc phục dựng toàn bộ quá khứ là bất khả; khi sự kiện đã trôi qua, không thể kiểm chứng tường thuật so với sự kiện mà chỉ có thể kiểm chứng so với tường thuật khác; ghi chép lịch sử do sử gia nối kết và xây dựng, và quá trình tạo lập tự sự bao gồm lý giải và đọc hiểu có chọn lọc;[195] tự thân bằng chứng cũng là chủ quan một cách tất yếu do nội dung trong bằng chứng được nối kết thông qua người tạo ra nó và sự tồn tại qua các quá trình chọn lọc.[196] Từ góc nhìn này, nhận thức muộn và lý thuyết hóa hiện đại cũng cho phép sử gia kết hợp bằng chứng và đưa ra lý giải vốn chỉ có thể thấy được sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra dưới góc độ thiên lệch, tức là lịch sử dưới hình thức quá khứ đã biết là sản phẩm do con người tạo ra.[197]
^ Trong những người đề xướng quan điểm theo thiên hướng thuyết tương đối có E. H. Carr, tác giả của What Is History? (1961) vốn khảo sát tác động từ bối cảnh lịch sử và xã hội đến cách lựa chọn và phân tích dữ kiện của giới sử học.[200]
^ Một số học giả cho rằng việc nhận diện bản chất chủ quan của tư liệu lịch sử là cơ hội để mở ra các lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và phương pháp mới trong làm việc với chủ thể lịch sử; đồng thời cũng mang lại những hướng tiếp cận mới trong phân tích sử liệu, phê phán tự sự chính thống và cho phép nhà sử học làm việc với nhiều khái niệm khác nhau.[202]
^ Richard J. Evans là một trong số những học giả ủng hộ quan điểm này.[203]
^ Chẳng hạn, một số sách giáo khoa lịch sử cấp trung học phổ thông của Nhật Bản đã bị chỉ trích do cố ý hạ thấp những hoạt động thực dân và tham chiến của nước này.[213]
^ Chúng đôi khi được gộp lại thành một nhóm có tên khoa học phụ trợ của lịch sử.[218]

Lịch sử là nghiên cứu có hệ thống về quá khứ, tập trung chủ yếu vào quá khứ của loài người. Dưới hình thức một môn học, lịch sử phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng để tường thuật lại những gì đã xảy ra và giải thích lý do cũng như cách thức mà sự việc đó xảy ra. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội còn số khác xem đây là bộ phận của nhân văn học hoặc là một bộ môn hỗn hợp. Có nhiều tranh luận tương tự xoay quanh mục đích của lịch sử, chẳng hạn như liệu mục tiêu chính của nó là để khám phá chân lý (hướng lý thuyết) hay là rút ra bài học kinh nghiệm từ quá khứ (hướng thực tiễn). Theo cách hiểu suy rộng, ngoài ý nghĩa lĩnh vực học thuật, thuật ngữ lịch sử còn chỉ cả bản thân quá khứ, những thời điểm trong quá khứ hoặc các văn bản riêng lẻ liên quan đến quá khứ.

Nghiên cứu lịch sử phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tư liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp để tái hiện các sự kiện trong quá khứ và xác nhận diễn giải. Phê phán sử liệu là một phương pháp được sử dụng để đánh giá những nguồn này dựa trên tính xác thực, nội dung và độ tin cậy. Giới sử học thường cố gắng kết hợp quan điểm giữa nhiều nguồn tài liệu để tạo nên mạch tự sự thống nhất. Các trường phái tư tưởng khác nhau như chủ nghĩa thực chứng, trường phái Annales, chủ nghĩa Marx và chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại có cách tiếp cận phương pháp luận khác nhau.

Lịch sử là một bộ môn rộng bao gồm nhiều nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào các giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể (ví dụ như thời kỳ cổ đại), còn số khác hướng đến những khu vực địa lý nhất định (chẳng hạn như lịch sử châu Phi). Theo phạm vi lĩnh vực, lịch sử có thể được phân loại thành lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử quân sự, lịch sử xã hội, lịch sử kinh tế, v.v. Các phân nhánh theo loại tư liệu và phương pháp nghiên cứu bao gồm lịch sử định lượng, lịch sử so sánh và lịch sử truyền miệng.

Lịch sử ra đời dưới hình thức lĩnh vực nghiên cứu ở thời cổ đại thay thế những câu chuyện truyền thuyết, bắt nguồn chủ yếu ở Hy Lạp, Trung Quốc và sau này là thế giới Hồi giáo. Ghi chép lịch sử trải qua nhiều biến đổi theo thời gian và ngày càng có tính chuyên nghiệp cao, nhất là vào thế kỷ 19 với sự xuất hiện một phương pháp luận nghiêm ngặt cùng hàng loạt cơ sở học thuật được thành lập. Lịch sử có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực như sử luận, triết học, giáo dục và chính trị.

Định nghĩa
Theo sử gia Đào Duy Anh (1932), lịch sử (ánh xạ với tiếng Pháp histoire) được định nghĩa là "biên chép những sự biến thiên diên cách trải qua các đời" hoặc "biên chép những việc lớn của quốc gia, xã hội".[1]

Dưới dạng một bộ môn học thuật, lịch sử là ngành nghiên cứu về quá khứ, đặc biệt là quá khứ của loài người.[2] Mục tiêu của lịch sử là khái quát và tái hiện những gì đã xảy ra bằng cách thu thập và phân tích các bằng chứng để tổng hợp thành tường thuật. Những tường thuật này làm sáng tỏ diễn biến vụ việc, nguyên nhân hình thành và bối cảnh lịch sử cụ thể, qua đó giải thích điều kiện bối cảnh và cơ chế nhân quả liên quan đến chúng. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn phân tích ý nghĩa của những sự việc trong quá khứ và khám phá những động cơ đã thúc đẩy hành động của con người.[3]

Theo một định nghĩa khác, lịch sử chỉ bản thân các sự kiện trong quá khứ. Theo cách hiểu này, lịch sử chính là những gì đã xảy ra thay vì là môn học thuật nghiên cứu những điều đã xảy ra. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn có một nghĩa khác là ghi chép về quá khứ dưới hình thức văn bản. Văn bản lịch sử là sản phẩm văn hóa phản ánh quá trình lý giải và tái cấu trúc thường xuyên từ các nhà sử học. Cách tường thuật trong các văn bản lịch sử có thể thay đổi khi nhà sử học tìm thấy bằng chứng mới hoặc lý giải lại sử liệu hiện có. Trái lại, bản thân quá khứ là bất biến và không thể thay đổi.[4] Một số sử gia tập trung vào các khía cạnh lý giải và giải thích để phân biệt lịch sử với biên niên sử, với luận điểm rằng biên niên sử chỉ liệt kê các sự kiện theo trình tự thời gian còn lịch sử hướng đến hiểu biết toàn diện về nguyên nhân, bối cảnh đến hệ quả.[5]

Từ trước đến nay, lịch sử chủ yếu nghiên cứu những gì được con người ghi lại bằng chữ viết. Vì thế, môn này tập trung vào các sự kiện xảy ra sau khi con người phát minh ra chữ viết (gọi là lịch sử ghi chép), còn thời kỳ trước đó, gọi là thời tiền sử,[a] thường do ngành khảo cổ học nghiên cứu.[7] Tuy nhiên, sang thế kỷ 20, các nhà sử học đã mở rộng phạm vi và bắt đầu quan tâm nhiều hơn đến quá khứ của loài người trước thời điểm chữ viết ra đời.[8][b]

Giới sử học tranh luận về việc lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội hay là bộ phận của nhân văn học. Tương tự như với khoa học xã hội, nhà sử học xây dựng giả thuyết, thu thập bằng chứng khách quan và trình bày luận điểm dựa trên bằng chứng đó. Mặt khác, lịch sử cũng liên hệ chặt chẽ với nhân văn học vì phụ thuộc vào các khía cạnh chủ quan gắn liền với sự lý giải, kể chuyện, kinh nghiệm của con người và di sản văn hóa.[10] Một số sử gia ủng hộ phân loại theo chỉ một trong hai cách nêu trên, còn số khác xem lịch sử là một môn hỗn hợp không thuộc về phạm trù cụ thể nào theo hướng loại trừ với phạm trù còn lại.[11] Lịch sử đối lập với ngụy sử, một thuật ngữ chỉ sử luận lệch chuẩn do dùng bằng chứng lịch sử gây tranh cãi, cố tình bỏ qua bằng chứng đã xác thực hoặc sử dụng cách thức khác để bóp méo ghi chép lịch sử. Thường được thúc đẩy bởi một số ý thức hệ nhất định, ngụy sử bắt chước phương pháp lịch sử để truyền bá cách tường thuật thiên lệch, gây hiểu lầm, không dựa trên phân tích nghiêm ngặt và thiếu sự đồng thuận về mặt học thuật.[12]

Mục đích
Đã có nhiều ý kiến được đưa ra về mục đích hoặc giá trị của lịch sử. Một số sử gia cho rằng mục đích chính của lịch sử chỉ đơn giản là tìm ra chân lý về quá khứ. Theo quan điểm này, mưu cầu chân lý công tâm là một mục đích tự thân và không nên bị ảnh hưởng bởi những mục đích bên ngoài như chính trị hay ý thức hệ, vì như vậy có thể xuyên tạc quá khứ và ảnh hưởng xấu đến độ chính xác của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Khi đóng vai trò đi tìm chân lý, lịch sử còn có nhiệm vụ làm sáng tỏ những câu chuyện truyền miệng hay thần thoại đã tồn tại từ lâu nhưng thiếu bằng chứng xác thực.[13][c]

Một góc nhìn khác cho rằng giá trị cốt lõi của lịch sử nằm ở những bài học kinh nghiệm để lại cho nhân loại ngày nay. Ý tưởng ở đây là hiểu rõ quá khứ sẽ giúp con người ra quyết định tốt hơn, chẳng hạn như để tránh lặp lại sai lầm của quá khứ.[15] Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn giúp ta hiểu về bản chất con người. Trong những bối cảnh và thời đại khác nhau, con người sẽ cư xử khác đi, giống như việc người ta du lịch để học hỏi về các nền văn hóa mới vậy.[16] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò là chất keo gắn kết xã hội. Khi nhiều người có chung một quá khứ, họ hình thành một bản sắc tập thể vững chắc, nhờ đó các di sản và giá trị văn hóa được bảo tồn và lưu truyền qua nhiều thế hệ.[17] Đối với một số học giả, bao gồm giới sử gia Whig và học giả Mác-xít E. H. Carr, lịch sử là chìa khóa để am hiểu hiện tại[18] và (theo Carr) định hình tương lai.[19]

Lịch sử đôi lúc cũng được sử dụng làm công cụ chính trị và công cụ tuyên truyền, ví dụ như ca ngợi những truyền thống cũ nhằm giúp giới cầm quyền duy trì hiện trạng hoặc phơi bày những bất công trong quá khứ để thúc đẩy thay đổi.[20] Ở dạng cực đoan, người ta cố ý bỏ qua hoặc xuyên tạc bằng chứng để tạo ra những câu chuyện hoàn toàn sai lệch, dẫn đến ngụy sử hoặc xuyên tạc lịch sử.[12][d] Một số ví dụ tiêu biểu gồm phủ nhận sự tồn tại của nạn diệt chủng Holocaust, diệt chủng Armenia, thảm sát Nam Kinh và Holodomor.[22]

Từ lịch sử trong tiếng Việt là cách đọc Hán-Việt của hai chữ 歷史 (lìshǐ).[1]

Từ history trong tiếng Anh bắt nguồn từ chữ Hy Lạp cổ ἵστωρ (histōr) tức 'người có học, thông thái'. Từ này phái sinh từ Hy Lạp cổ ἱστορία (historiā), vốn mang nghĩa rộng gắn với tra vấn nói chung và đưa ra lời chứng. Thuật ngữ sau đó được chuyển tự sang tiếng Latinh cổ điển thành historia. Vào thời Hy Lạp hóa và La Mã, ý nghĩa của thuật ngữ có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào khía cạnh tường thuật và nghệ thuật trình bày thay vì nghiên cứu và lời chứng.[24]

Từ history du nhập vào tiếng Anh trung đại vào thế kỷ 14 thông qua chữ histoire của tiếng Pháp cổ.[25] Lúc bấy giờ, nó có nghĩa là 'câu chuyện, truyện kể', gồm cả tường thuật có thật và hư cấu. Vào thế kỷ 15, nghĩa của từ này thay đổi theo hướng bao hàm nhánh tri thức nghiên cứu quá khứ đi đôi với tự sự về quá khứ.[26] Đến thế kỷ 18 và 19, chữ history dần liên hệ chặt chẽ hơn với tường thuật thực tế và tra vấn dựa trên bằng chứng cùng thời điểm với giai đoạn chuyên nghiệp hóa của nghiên cứu lịch sử, một ý nghĩa hiện còn mang tính chi phối trong cách dùng từ đương đại.[27] Ý nghĩa bao hàm cả truyện kể đơn thuần và tự sự có thật về quá khứ cũng hiện diện trong thuật ngữ lịch sử ở nhiều ngôn ngữ châu Âu khác như histoire (tiếng Pháp), storia (tiếng Ý) và Geschichte (tiếng Đức).[28]

Phương pháp
Bài chi tiết: Phương pháp lịch sử
Phương pháp lịch sử là một tập hợp các kỹ thuật mà giới sử học áp dụng để nghiên cứu và lý giải quá khứ, bao gồm các quy trình thu thập, đánh giá và tổng hợp chứng cứ.[e] Phương pháp lịch sử nhằm đảm bảo tính nghiêm ngặt, chính xác và độ tin cậy học thuật về cách lựa chọn, phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng lịch sử.[30] Nghiên cứu lịch sử thường bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi nghiên cứu để xác định phạm vi đề tài. Một số câu hỏi nghiên cứu tập trung đơn thuần vào mô tả những gì đã xảy ra, trong khi số khác hướng đến giải thích lý do một sự kiện cụ thể xảy ra, bác bỏ giả thuyết đã có hoặc xác nhận một giả thuyết mới.[31]

Sử liệu và phê phán sử liệu
Để giải đáp câu hỏi nghiên cứu, các sử gia sử dụng nhiều loại bằng chứng khác nhau để tái hiện lại quá khứ và củng cố cho kết luận của mình. Bằng chứng lịch sử thường được chia thành nguồn sơ cấp và thứ cấp.[32] Nguồn sơ cấp là những thứ được hình thành ngay trong thời kỳ đó. Có nhiều loại nguồn sơ cấp như tài liệu chính thức, thư từ, nhật ký, lời kể của nhân chứng, ảnh chụp, bản ghi âm hoặc ghi hình. Tư liệu sơ cấp còn bao gồm dấu tích lịch sử được tìm thấy qua khảo cổ học, địa chất học và y khoa, ví dụ như hiện vật và hóa thạch lấy từ các cuộc khai quật. Nguồn sơ cấp cho ta bằng chứng trực tiếp nhất về các sự kiện quá khứ.[33]

Nguồn thứ cấp là tư liệu phân tích hoặc lý giải thông tin của tư liệu khác.[35] Việc một nguồn tài liệu được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp phụ thuộc cả vào bản chất lẫn mục đích sử dụng của tư liệu đó. Chẳng hạn, tài liệu nghiên cứu về chế độ nô lệ được viết bằng cách phân tích các tài liệu lịch sử sẽ là nguồn thứ cấp khi nói về chế độ nô lệ nhưng lại là nguồn sơ cấp về quan điểm của sử gia đó.[36][f] Một trong những tiêu chuẩn phải có của một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử đáng tin cậy là tính nhất quán với các tư liệu đã có. Nếu các nhà sử học tìm thấy những nguồn tài liệu mới, họ có thể sẽ phải sửa đổi hoặc bác bỏ những câu chuyện lịch sử đã và đang được công nhận.[38] Để tìm kiếm và tiếp cận với sử liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp, các sử gia thường tra cứu kho lưu trữ, thư viện và bảo tàng. Kho lưu trữ đóng vai trò chủ chốt qua việc lưu lại và công khai vô số tư liệu nguyên bản đến giới nghiên cứu một cách có hệ thống và dễ tiếp cận. Nhờ những tiến bộ công nghệ, giới sử học đang ngày càng tận dụng nguồn tài nguyên trực tuyến với các cơ sở dữ liệu phong phú cùng những kỹ thuật tìm kiếm và truy cập tài liệu.[39]

Phê phán sử liệu là quá trình phân tích và đánh giá thông tin mà một tư liệu cung cấp.[g] Thông thường, quá trình này bắt đầu bằng phê phán ngoại tại, tức là đánh giá tính xác thực của sử liệu bằng cách đặt ra những câu hỏi như sử liệu này ra đời khi nào, ở đâu, ai là tác giả, mục đích người đó làm ra sử liệu là gì, sử liệu có từng bị chỉnh sửa gì sau thời điểm xuất bản hay không. Ngoài ra, phê phán ngoại tại còn bao gồm phân biệt giữa bản gốc, bản sao và bản làm giả.[41]

Phê phán nội tại là đánh giá nội dung của tư liệu, thường bắt đầu bằng việc làm rõ ý nghĩa những gì tư liệu muốn nói. Việc này bao gồm làm rõ nghĩa những từ ngữ có thể gây nhầm lẫn, hoặc nếu tài liệu viết bằng một ngôn ngữ lạ thì cần phải dịch nó ra.[h] Khi đã hiểu nội dung, bước quan trọng nhất là xác định tính chính xác: thông tin có đáng tin không, có bị bóp méo hay trình bày sai sự thật không, có đầy đủ không, có bỏ sót chi tiết quan trọng nào không. Một cách tiến hành những việc trên là đánh giá khả năng trình bày trung thực sự kiện được nghiên cứu của tác giả về mặt nguyên tắc. Ngoài ra, còn có một số phương pháp tiếp cận khác như đánh giá tầm ảnh hưởng của ý định hay thiên kiến từ tác giả và tham chiếu thông tin với các nguồn đáng tin cậy khác. Nhận biết về thiếu sót của sử liệu giúp các nhà sử học quyết định có nên tin tưởng sử liệu đó hay không, nếu có thì nên tin những khía cạnh gì và nên sử dụng nó như thế nào để xây dựng tường thuật.[43]

Tổng hợp lịch sử và các trường phái tư tưởng
Từ bước lựa chọn, phân tích và phê phán sử liệu, sử gia sẽ xác minh được một lượng lớn các luận điểm độc lập về quá khứ. Ở bước tiếp theo, đôi khi còn gọi là tổng hợp lịch sử, nhà sử học sẽ tìm hiểu cách thức liên kết những bằng chứng riêng lẻ đó thành một bức tranh tổng thể.[i] Việc xây dựng góc nhìn bao quát là cần thiết để có sự hiểu biết toàn diện về đề tài nghiên cứu. Đây là một khía cạnh sáng tạo[j] của ghi chép lịch sử nhằm tái hiện và lý giải những gì đã xảy ra thông qua việc xác định mối liên hệ giữa nhiều sự kiện khác nhau.[46] Nhờ đó, sử gia có thể xác định được những sự kiện nào đã diễn ra, nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng là gì.[47] Tuy không có kỹ thuật duy nhất nào được chấp nhận rộng rãi, giới sử học vẫn áp dụng nhiều công cụ và cách tiếp cận diễn giải trong quá trình trên.[48]

Auguste Comte là người phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng, ủng hộ tiếp cận lịch sử trên cơ sở khoa học.[49]
Một công cụ giúp khái quát và trình bày dễ hiểu các quá trình phát triển phức tạp là phân kỳ lịch sử, tức là chia một khoảng thời gian thành nhiều giai đoạn riêng biệt, mỗi giai đoạn được xác định bởi một chủ đề hoặc quá trình phát triển chủ đạo. Ví dụ, hệ thống ba thời đại thường được sử dụng để phân chia lịch sử loài người thuở đầu thành thời đại đồ đá, thời đại đồ đồng và thời đại đồ sắt dựa trên loại nguyên vật liệu và công nghệ chủ yếu đặc trưng cho từng thời kỳ.[50] Một phương pháp khác là nghiên cứu khoảng trống trong ghi chép lịch sử, tức những sự kiện đã từng xảy ra nhưng không để lại bằng chứng đáng kể nào. Những khoảng trống này có thể xuất hiện khi người đương thời cho rằng thông tin quá hiển nhiên nên không cần ghi lại, hoặc khi thông tin bị cố ý giấu giếm hay tiêu hủy.[51][k] Ngược lại, khi có sẵn các tập dữ liệu lớn thì sử gia có thể sử dụng hướng tiếp cận định lượng. Chẳng hạn, các nhà sử học kinh tế và xã hội thường áp dụng phương pháp phân tích thống kê để nhận diện quy luật và xu hướng trong phạm vi tập thể rộng lớn.[54]

Mỗi trường phái tư tưởng có quan điểm riêng về mặt phương pháp luận trong ghi chép lịch sử.[55] Những nhà sử học theo chủ nghĩa thực chứng xem nghiên cứu lịch sử là một hoạt động mang tính khoa học và cho rằng bằng chứng thực nghiệm đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tìm kiếm chân lý khách quan.[56] Trái lại, các nhà hậu hiện đại phủ nhận tính hợp lệ của những đại tự sự vốn được cho là mang lại một chân lý khách quan duy nhất. Chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại thay vào đó đề cao bản chất chủ quan của lý giải lịch sử và xem đây là nền tảng cho sự đa dạng của các quan điểm lịch sử khác nhau.[57] Những nhà Mác-xít cho rằng mọi sự phát triển lịch sử đều bắt nguồn từ động lực kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp.[58] Trường phái Annales tập trung nghiên cứu các xu hướng kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn, lấy những phương pháp định lượng và tiếp cận liên ngành làm trọng tâm.[59] Sử học nữ quyền nghiên cứu vai trò của giới tính xã hội trong lịch sử, đặc biệt quan tâm đến việc phân tích kinh nghiệm của phụ nữ và phê phán các quan niệm mang tính phụ quyền trong chép sử truyền thống.[60]

Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu
Lịch sử là một lĩnh vực nghiên cứu rộng bao gồm nhiều phân nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào một giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể còn số khác tập trung vào một khu vực địa lý hoặc đề tài nhất định. Một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử thường có thể có sự kết hợp nhiều hướng chuyên môn khác nhau; chẳng hạn, một tác phẩm về lịch sử kinh tế ở Ai Cập cổ đại có sự tổng hợp các góc nhìn về mặt thời gian, không gian và chủ đề. Đối với đề tài phạm vi rộng, lượng sử liệu sơ cấp liên quan thường quá lớn để có thể khảo cứu hết, buộc sử gia phải thu hẹp tầm vực chủ đề nghiên cứu hoặc sử dụng thêm tài liệu thứ cấp để đi đến kết luận tổng quan.[61]

Theo giai đoạn
Phân chia theo trình tự thời gian là một cách tiếp cận thường gặp để sắp xếp tiến trình lịch sử rộng lớn thành nhiều phân đoạn. Việc xác định các thời kỳ thường dựa trên những đặc trưng nổi bật của một giai đoạn nhất định cùng với các sự kiện quan trọng đánh dấu sự khởi đầu hoặc kết thúc những bước phát triển đó. Tùy vào bối cảnh nghiên cứu và mức độ chi tiết mà một thời kỳ có thể kéo dài từ vài thập kỷ đến hàng thế kỷ.[62] Một hướng tiếp cận tiêu biểu là chia lịch sử thế giới thành thời tiền sử, thời kỳ cổ đại, thời kỳ trung đại, thời kỳ cận đại và thời kỳ hiện đại.[63][l] Tuy nhiên, tùy theo khu vực và chủ đề nghiên cứu mà có thể có sự khác biệt về ranh giới thời gian giữa các thời kỳ trên và giới sử học cũng có thể sử dụng cách phân kỳ hoàn toàn khác.[65] Chẳng hạn, lịch sử Trung Quốc thường được phân kỳ theo các triều đại chính,[66] trong khi lịch sử châu Mỹ lại thường được chia theo các giai đoạn tiền Colombo, thực dân và hậu thực dân.[67]

Các nhà sử học sử dụng bằng chứng từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau để nghiên cứu thời tiền sử, bao gồm cả hóa thạch như Lucy.[68]
Nghiên cứu thời tiền sử bao gồm khảo sát quá trình tiến hóa của các loài người cổ cách đây vài triệu năm, dẫn đến sự xuất hiện của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu khoảng 200.000 năm trước.[69] Thời gian sau đó, loài người dần di cư khỏi châu Phi để cư trú ở hầu khắp Trái Đất. Về cuối thời tiền sử, những tiến bộ về công nghệ (nhất là trong chế tác công cụ) đã khiến nhiều cộng đồng người từ bỏ lối sống du mục quen thuộc dựa vào săn bắt và hái lượm và chuyển sang lối sống ít vận động dựa trên những hoạt động nông nghiệp sơ khai.[70] Sự thiếu vắng tài liệu thành văn từ thời kỳ này để lại nhiều thách thức đối với các nhà nghiên cứu và là nền tảng để cho ra đời một phương pháp tiếp cận liên ngành trên cơ sở tổng hợp những dạng bằng chứng khác từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, nhân loại học, cổ sinh vật học và địa chất học.[71]

Giới sử gia nghiên cứu thời cổ đại khảo sát sự hình thành các nền văn minh lớn đầu tiên ở những khu vực như Lưỡng Hà, Ai Cập, lưu vực sông Ấn, Trung Quốc và Peru, bắt đầu từ khoảng năm 3500 TCN tại một số nơi. Những biến đổi phức tạp trong xã hội, kinh tế và chính trị đã tạo điều kiện cho việc phát triển các hệ thống chữ viết đầu tiên. Nhờ những thành tựu mới về nông nghiệp, lượng lương thực thặng dư đã giúp các nền văn minh trên nuôi sống được quy mô dân số ngày càng lớn, kéo theo quá trình đô thị hóa, sự thành lập nhiều mạng lưới thương mại và sự xuất hiện những đế chế khu vực. Ở giai đoạn sau của thời cổ đại, đôi khi còn gọi là thời kỳ cổ điển, các xã hội tại Trung Quốc, Ấn Độ, Ba Tư và Địa Trung Hải tiếp tục mở rộng và đạt đến đỉnh cao mới về văn hóa, khoa học và chính trị. Cùng lúc đó, nhiều hệ thống tôn giáo và tư tưởng triết học lớn như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Do Thái giáo và triết học Hy Lạp cũng được hình thành tại đây.[72]

Trong nghiên cứu về thời kỳ trung đại (bắt đầu vào khoảng năm 500 CN), giới sử học đề cập đến tầm ảnh hưởng ngày càng sâu rộng của những tôn giáo lớn. Các tôn giáo truyền đạo như Phật giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo lan tỏa nhanh chóng và trở thành tôn giáo thế giới, đánh dấu bước chuyển dịch lớn về văn hóa khi dần thay thế nhiều hệ tín ngưỡng khác. Cùng thời điểm, các mạng lưới thương mại liên khu vực phát triển mạnh mẽ, thúc đẩy sự giao lưu về công nghệ và văn hóa. Vào thế kỷ 13 và 14, đế quốc Mông Cổ xâm lược nhiều vùng lãnh thổ ở châu Á và châu Âu và trở thành thế lực thống trị hàng đầu.[73]

Các sử gia chuyên nghiên cứu thời cận đại (bắt đầu khoảng năm 1500 CN) thường tập trung phân tích quá trình trỗi dậy và thâu tóm quyền lực toàn cầu của các nước châu Âu. Những nước đế quốc thuốc súng này đã tiến hành khai phá và thực dân hóa nhiều khu vực rộng lớn trên thế giới. Hệ quả là châu Mỹ được kết nối vào mạng lưới toàn cầu, khởi đầu cho một cuộc trao đổi sinh học quy mô lớn với sự di chuyển của cả thực vật, động vật, con người và mầm bệnh.[m] Cách mạng khoa học là xúc tác cho các phát kiến lớn và tăng tốc tiến bộ công nghệ, song song với đó là nhiều bước tiến khác về tri thức như chủ nghĩa nhân văn và thời kỳ Khai Sáng, mở đường cho tiến trình thế tục hóa.[75]

Cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp có tác động sâu rộng đến đời sống kinh tế và xã hội, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ xã hội nông nghiệp sang xã hội công nghiệp.[76]
Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử hiện đại (bắt đầu vào cuối thế kỷ 18), giới sử học quan tâm đến cách mà cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp làm chuyển dịch các nền kinh tế nhờ việc cho ra đời những phương thức sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Các cường quốc phương Tây thành lập những đế chế thực dân rộng lớn và củng cố ưu thế nhờ công nghệ quân sự công nghiệp hóa. Sự gia tăng trao đổi hàng hóa, tư tưởng và con người đánh dấu bước đầu của quá trình toàn cầu hóa. Hàng loạt cuộc cách mạng xã hội bùng nổ chống lại các chế độ chuyên quyền và thực dân, đặt nền móng cho những thể chế dân chủ. Nhiều lĩnh vực như khoa học, công nghệ, kinh tế, mức sống và dân số tăng trưởng với tốc độ chưa từng có bất chấp tàn phá nặng nề từ hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới, vốn đã làm thay đổi căn bản cán cân quyền lực quốc tế với sự suy yếu vai trò thống trị của châu Âu.[77]

Theo vị trí địa lý
Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng có thể được phân loại theo vị trí địa lý.[78] Yếu tố địa lý đóng vai trò quan trọng trong lịch sử do có ảnh hưởng đến sản xuất thực phẩm, tài nguyên thiên nhiên, hoạt động kinh tế, ranh giới chính trị và giao lưu văn hóa.[79][n] Một số tác phẩm lịch sử có phạm vi nghiên cứu chỉ ở những khu vực nhỏ như làng xã hay khu định cư, còn số khác tập trung vào các vùng lãnh thổ rộng lớn trải khắp toàn bộ châu lục, ví dụ như lịch sử châu Phi, châu Á, châu Âu, châu Mỹ và châu Đại Dương.[81]

Quần thể kim tự tháp Giza đại diện cho di sản lâu đời của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại.[82]
Lịch sử châu Phi khởi đầu với nghiên cứu về sự tiến hóa của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu.[83] Các nhà sử học cổ đại mô tả quá trình phát minh chữ viết và cái nôi của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại vào thiên niên kỷ 4 TCN.[84] Trong thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, nhiều nền văn minh và vương quốc tiêu biểu khác được hình thành tại Nubia, Axum, Carthage, Ghana, Mali và Songhay.[85] Hồi giáo bắt đầu lan truyền khắp Bắc Phi vào thế kỷ 7 CN và trở thành đức tin lớn nhất ở nhiều đế quốc. Trong khi đó, hoạt động thương mại dọc theo tuyến xuyên Sahara phát triển mạnh.[86] Từ thế kỷ 15, hàng triệu người châu Phi bị bắt làm nô lệ và đưa sang châu Mỹ trong khuôn khổ cuộc buôn bán nô lệ Đại Tây Dương.[87] Phần lớn châu lục rơi vào ách đô hộ của các cường quốc châu Âu vào cuối thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20.[88] Trước làn sóng chủ nghĩa dân tộc, các nước châu Phi dần giành lại độc lập trong giai đoạn sau Thế chiến II, một thời kỳ chứng kiến tiến bộ kinh tế, tăng trưởng nhanh về dân số và đấu tranh vì ổn định chính trị.[89]

Giới sử học nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Á nhận thấy người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 100.000 năm trước.[90] Châu Á được xem là một trong những cái nôi của nền văn minh nhân loại với sự ra đời một số nền văn minh cổ đại đầu tiên ở Lưỡng Hà, lưu vực sông Ấn và Trung Quốc bắt đầu từ thiên niên kỷ thứ 4 và thứ 3 TCN.[91] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, các nền văn minh ở châu Á lục địa sản sinh ra tất cả các tôn giáo thế giới lớn và một số truyền thống triết học tiêu biểu như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Đạo giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo.[92] Khoảng thời gian này còn chứng kiến việc con đường tơ lụa được thành lập nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại và trao đổi văn hóa trên khắp lục địa Á-Âu, cùng với đó là sự hình thành các đế chế hùng mạnh như đế quốc Mông Cổ.[93] Ảnh hưởng của châu Âu dần gia tăng trong những thế kỷ tiếp theo, mở ra thời kỳ hiện đại, và đạt đỉnh vào thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20 khi nhiều khu vực của châu Á rơi vào ách cai trị thực dân đến khi Thế chiến II kết thúc.[94] Sau khi giành lại độc lập, các quốc gia châu Á bước vào giai đoạn hiện đại hóa với nền kinh tế và quy mô dân số tăng trưởng nhanh.[95]

Do tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến văn hóa và triết học phương Tây, Hy Lạp cổ đại là một đối tượng nghiên cứu quan trọng đối với các nhà sử học châu Âu.[96]
Trong nghiên cứu lịch sử châu Âu, các sử gia mô tả sự xuất hiện của những người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đầu tiên cách đây khoảng 45.000 năm.[97] Nhiều công trình nghiên cứu tập trung tìm hiểu những đóng góp quan trọng từ Hy Lạp cổ đại cho văn hóa, triết học và chính trị gắn liền với thế giới phương Tây vào thiên niên kỷ thứ nhất TCN,[96] cũng như cảm hứng từ di sản văn hóa của nền văn minh này đối với đế quốc La Mã và Đông La Mã.[98] Thời kỳ trung đại bắt đầu với việc đế quốc Tây La Mã sụp đổ vào thế kỷ 5 CN và được đánh dấu bởi làn sóng lan truyền Kitô giáo.[99] Từ thế kỷ 15, công cuộc khai phá và thuộc địa hóa từ châu Âu đã làm kết nối các châu lục lại với nhau, trong khi những bước tiến văn hóa, tri thức và khoa học thúc đẩy sự thay đổi của nhiều xã hội phương Tây.[100] Từ cuối thế kỷ 18 đến đầu thế kỷ 20, thế thống trị toàn cầu của châu Âu được củng cố bởi cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp và sự thành lập các thuộc địa lớn.[101] Thế thống trị đó chấm dứt do hậu quả thảm khốc của hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới.[102] Đến thời Chiến tranh Lạnh, châu lục bị chia cắt thành một khối phía Tây và một khối phía Đông. Cả hai khối cùng thúc đẩy hợp tác chính trị và kinh tế sâu rộng hơn sau khi Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc.[103]

Giới sử học khảo sát lịch sử châu Mỹ ghi nhận sự hiện diện những con người đầu tiên vào khoảng 20.000 đến 15.000 năm trước.[104] Châu Mỹ là cái nôi của vài trong số các nền văn minh sớm nhất như văn minh Norte Chico ở Nam Mỹ và văn minh Maya và Olmec ở Trung Mỹ.[105] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo chứng kiến sự xuất hiện nhiều đế chế lớn như Teotihuacan, Aztec và đế quốc Inca.[106] Sau khi người châu Âu gia nhập lục địa từ cuối thế kỷ 15, nhiều căn bệnh truyền nhiễm mới lan rộng dẫn đến dân số sụt giảm nghiêm trọng. Việc này cùng với quá trình thực dân hóa đã khiến các đế chế lớn sụp đổ và làm cấu trúc nhân khẩu học cũng như diện mạo văn hóa thay đổi toàn diện.[107] Các phong trào độc lập vào thế kỷ 18 và 19 dẫn đến việc hình thành những quốc gia mới trên khắp châu Mỹ.[108] Đến thế kỷ 20, Mỹ vươn lên trở thành cường quốc toàn cầu và đóng vai trò nổi bật trong cục diện Chiến tranh Lạnh.[109]

Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Đại Dương, các sử gia nhận định con người đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 60.000 đến 50.000 năm trước.[110] Quá trình phát triển các xã hội và nền văn hóa khu vực đa dạng được ghi nhận đầu tiên ở Úc và Papua New Guinea, sau mới đến các đảo khác thuộc Thái Bình Dương.[111] Sự gia nhập của người châu Âu vào thế kỷ 16 mang đến nhiều biến đổi sâu sắc, và đến cuối thế kỷ 19 phần lớn khu vực đã bị các nước phương Tây kiểm soát.[112] Châu Đại Dương đã tham gia nhiều cuộc xung đột trong hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới và trải qua giai đoạn phi thực dân hóa trong thời hậu chiến.[113]

Theo đề tài
Giới sử học thường giới hạn phạm vi khảo cứu về một chủ đề cụ thể.[114] Một số học giả đề xuất phân chia tổng quát thành ba đề tài chính: lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử kinh tế và lịch sử xã hội. Tuy nhiên, ranh giới giữa các phân nhánh này là mơ hồ và quan hệ giữa chúng với các phân nhánh đề tài khác như lịch sử trí thức không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng.[115]

Lịch sử chính trị nghiên cứu tổ chức quyền lực trong xã hội, tìm hiểu cách thức ra đời, phát triển và tác động qua lại của các cấu trúc quyền lực. Nhà nước hoặc các cấu trúc tương tự nhà nước là đối tượng trọng tâm của lĩnh vực nghiên cứu này xuyên suốt phần lớn lịch sử được ghi chép. Lịch sử chính trị phân tích cơ chế tổ chức nội bộ của một quốc gia, ví dụ như bè phái, đảng phái, tầng lớp lãnh đạo và các thể chế chính trị khác. Phân nhánh này còn nghiên cứu về việc hoạch định và thực thi chính sách cũng như quan hệ giữa nhà nước với các quốc gia khác.[116] Lịch sử chính trị là một trong những phân nhánh lâu đời nhất của lịch sử do đã được các sử gia như Herodotos và Thucydides nghiên cứu từ thời cổ đại, trong khi các lĩnh vực con tiêu biểu khác chỉ mới được công nhận là phân nhánh độc lập vào thế kỷ trước.[117]

Lịch sử quân sự nghiên cứu về xung đột vũ trang, bao gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ quân sự như máy bắn đá.[118]
Lịch sử ngoại giao và lịch sử quân sự có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử chính trị. Lịch sử ngoại giao khảo sát quan hệ quốc tế giữa các quốc gia, bao gồm những vấn đề liên quan đến chính sách đối ngoại như đàm phán, toan tính chiến lược, hiệp ước và xung đột giữa các nước cũng như vai trò của các tổ chức quốc tế trong những quy trình này.[119] Lịch sử quân sự phân tích sự hình thành, phát triển và tác động của các cuộc xung đột vũ trang trong lịch sử thế giới. Phạm vi nghiên cứu của lịch sử quân sự bao gồm phân tích về các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như tìm hiểu một trận chiến hay nguyên nhân gây ra một cuộc chiến tranh. Lịch sử quân sự còn xem xét tổng quan về sự phát triển của chiến tranh, trong đó gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ, chiến lược, chiến thuật, hậu cần và thể chế quân sự.[120]

Lịch sử kinh tế nghiên cứu cách thức sản xuất, trao đổi và tiêu thụ hàng hóa. Lĩnh vực này bao quát những khía cạnh kinh tế như sử dụng đất, lao động và tư bản, cung và cầu hàng hóa, chi phí và tư liệu sản xuất, phân phối thu nhập và của cải. Các nhà sử học kinh tế thường chú trọng phân tích những xu hướng chung mang tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như lạm phát, hơn là hành động và quyết định của cá nhân. Nếu có đủ dữ liệu, họ thường sử dụng các phương pháp định lượng như phân tích thống kê. Ở những giai đoạn trước thời kỳ hiện đại, dữ liệu có sẵn thường bị hạn chế, buộc giới sử học kinh tế phải phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tài liệu khan hiếm và ngoại suy thông tin từ chúng.[121]

Lịch sử xã hội là một lĩnh vực rộng lớn chuyên nghiên cứu những hiện tượng xã hội, song định nghĩa chính xác của nó chưa có sự thống nhất. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem đây là ngành nghiên cứu về cuộc sống thường ngày ngoài phạm vi chính trị và kinh tế, bao gồm tập quán văn hóa, cấu trúc gia đình, quan hệ cộng đồng và giáo dục. Một hướng tiếp cận mật thiết chú trọng nhiều hơn vào khám phá kinh nghiệm từ các nhóm xã hội cụ thể như giai cấp, chủng tộc, giới tính hoặc nhóm tuổi đối với thế giới mình đang sinh sống. Các cách hiểu khác coi lịch sử xã hội là nghiên cứu về những vấn đề xã hội như đói nghèo, bệnh tật và tội phạm, hoặc mở rộng phạm vi để xem xét sự phát triển của toàn thể xã hội nói chung.[122] Một số lĩnh vực có liên hệ gần gũi với lịch sử xã hội bao gồm lịch sử văn hóa, lịch sử giới tính và lịch sử tôn giáo.[123]

Lịch sử trí thức là lịch sử về tư tưởng, chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình phát triển của các khái niệm, triết lý và ý thức hệ. Nhánh này đặc biệt quan tâm đến các lĩnh vực học thuật nhưng mặt khác còn bao gồm nghiên cứu về tín ngưỡng và định kiến trong đời sống của con người bình thường. Bên cạnh việc tìm hiểu các phong trào trí thức, lịch sử trí thức còn khảo sát bối cảnh văn hóa và xã hội đã góp phần định hình nên những phong trào đó cũng như ảnh hưởng từ chúng đối với các tiến trình lịch sử khác.[124] Là hai trong những lĩnh vực liên quan mật thiết, lịch sử triết học phân tích sự phát triển của tư tưởng triết lý[125] còn lịch sử khoa học nghiên cứu quá trình biến đổi của lý thuyết và thực tiễn khoa học, chẳng hạn như những đóng góp khoa học của Charles Darwin và Albert Einstein.[126] Lịch sử học nghệ thuật là một bộ môn khác có liên hệ với lịch sử trí thức, chuyên suy xét các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trong lịch sử cùng với sự phát triển của các hình thức, phong cách và trào lưu nghệ thuật. Lịch sử học nghệ thuật bao gồm bàn luận về bối cảnh văn hóa, xã hội và chính trị của sáng tạo nghệ thuật.[127]

Lịch sử môi trường nghiên cứu quan hệ giữa con người và môi trường sống, hướng đến am hiểu cách mà loài người và phần còn lại của tự nhiên tác động lẫn nhau trong chiều dài lịch sử.[128] Một số phân nhánh khác theo đề tài bao gồm lịch sử hiến pháp, lịch sử luật pháp, lịch sử đô thị, lịch sử kinh doanh, lịch sử công nghệ, lịch sử y học, lịch sử giáo dục và lịch sử dân tộc.[129]

Lĩnh vực khác
Một số phân nhánh của lịch sử được đặc trưng bởi phương pháp mà chúng áp dụng. Chẳng hạn, lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử phụ thuộc lần lượt vào các phương pháp định lượng và phương tiện truyền thông kỹ thuật số trong nghiên cứu.[130] Lịch sử so sánh đối chiếu các hiện tượng lịch sử thuộc những thời kỳ, khu vực hoặc nền văn hóa phân biệt để xem xét những điểm giống và khác nhau giữa chúng.[131] Không giống như hầu hết phân nhánh khác, lịch sử truyền miệng dựa vào lời kể thay vì tài liệu ghi chép, bao hàm tường thuật nhân chứng, chứng cứ nghe nói lại và truyền thuyết cộng đồng. Lịch sử truyền miệng phản ánh kinh nghiệm cá nhân, sự diễn giải và trí nhớ của những người dân thường, cho thấy tính chủ quan trong cách con người ghi nhớ lịch sử.[132] Lịch sử phản thực tế sử dụng tư duy phản thực tế để khảo sát những hướng đi khác của lịch sử và khám phá những gì có thể sẽ xảy ra dưới những điều kiện khác nhau.[133] Một vài phân nhánh nhất định của lịch sử được tách bạch dựa trên quan điểm lý thuyết, ví dụ như lịch sử Mác-xít và lịch sử nữ quyền.[134]

Lịch sử thế giới nghiên cứu lịch sử ở cấp độ toàn cầu, kết hợp với toàn bộ lịch sử loài người.[135]
Một số cách phân chia lĩnh vực tập trung vào tầm vực của đề tài nghiên cứu. Lịch sử Vĩ đại là nhánh có tầm vực rộng nhất, bao hàm mọi thứ từ Vụ Nổ Lớn cho đến hiện tại, kết hợp các yếu tố của vũ trụ học, địa chất học, sinh học và nhân loại học.[9] Lịch sử thế giới là một phân nhánh khác với phạm vi rộng, khảo sát toàn thể lịch sử loài người bắt đầu từ sự tiến hóa của các loài giống người.[135] Các thuật ngữ lịch sử vĩ mô hay lịch sử vi mô chỉ những cấp độ quy mô phân tích khác nhau, dao động từ các quy luật mang tính toàn cầu đến nghiên cứu chi tiết về bối cảnh địa phương, cộng đồng nhỏ, gia đình, cá nhân hoặc sự kiện cụ thể.[136] Có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử vi mô là thể loại tiểu sử lịch sử, chuyên thuật lại cuộc đời của một cá nhân trong bối cảnh thời đại và di sản mà nhân vật để lại.[137]

Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm các hoạt động nhằm trình bày lịch sử đến công chúng. Việc này thường diễn ra bên ngoài phạm vi học thuật truyền thống ở những bối cảnh như bảo tàng, di tích lịch sử, du lịch di sản và truyền thông đại chúng.[138]

Quá trình phát triển của bộ môn
Trước khi có chữ viết, tri thức lịch sử được lưu truyền chủ yếu qua truyền miệng.[139] Những bản ghi chép lịch sử sớm nhất thường đan xen giữa các sự kiện có thật với yếu tố thần thoại, chẳng hạn như Sử thi Gilgamesh từ Lưỡng Hà cổ đại và Odyssey, một tác phẩm của Hy Lạp cổ đại được cho là do Homeros sáng tác.[140] Xuất bản vào thế kỷ 5 TCN, cuốn Lịch sử của Herodotos[o] là một trong những công trình nền tảng của truyền thống sử học phương Tây, trong đó tác giả chú trọng vào khảo cứu dựa trên lý tính và bằng chứng thay vì những câu chuyện của Homeros và các thi sĩ khác.[142] Thucydides kế thừa và phát triển phương pháp của Herodotos nhưng tập trung nhiều hơn vào các tiến trình phát triển chính trị và quân sự cụ thể, trái ngược với phạm vi rộng cùng các yếu tố dân tộc chí trong tác phẩm của Herodotos.[143] Sử luận La Mã chịu ảnh hưởng lớn từ truyền thống Hy Lạp, kết hợp giữa việc ghi chép sự kiện và phán xét đạo đức về các nhân vật lịch sử.[p] Các sử gia La Mã thời kỳ đầu sử dụng phong cách biên niên sử, sắp xếp các sự kiện theo từng năm và hầu như không bình luận gì thêm, còn những tác giả về sau ưu tiên nhiều hơn vào tường thuật và phân tích.[145]

Sử ký của Tư Mã Thiên là một trong những tự sự lịch sử công phu ra đời sớm nhất về lịch sử Trung Quốc và thế giới theo hiểu biết của người Trung Hoa.[146]
Một truyền thống chép sử lớn khác ra đời tại Trung Quốc cổ đại với các tiền thân đầu tiên xuất hiện vào cuối thiên niên kỷ thứ 2 TCN. Truyền thống đó xem biên niên sử là hình thái cao nhất của ghi chép lịch sử và đề cao việc kiểm chứng dựa trên sử liệu. Tập quán này gắn liền với triết lý Nho gia và có liên hệ chặt chẽ với bộ máy chính quyền dưới hình thức triều đại cầm quyền. Các sử gia Trung Hoa đã phát triển một phương pháp chép sử mạch lạc và có hệ thống sớm hơn so với những nơi khác.[147] Công trình của Tư Mã Thiên có ảnh hưởng đặc biệt; phương pháp nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ cùng việc thêm thắt những quan điểm khác với chính thống từ ông đã định hình nên hệ tiêu chuẩn cho sử luận về sau.[148] Ở Ấn Độ cổ đại, tự sự lịch sử có sự gắn bó mật thiết với tôn giáo. Chúng thường kết hợp sự kiện có thật với các yếu tố siêu nhiên, điển hình như trong Mahabharata.[149]

Tại châu Âu thời trung đại, lịch sử chủ yếu được giáo sĩ ghi lại dưới hình thức biên niên sử. Giới sử gia Kitô giáo lấy truyền thống Hy-La và Do Thái làm cảm hứng để tường thuật lại quá khứ như một phần trong kế hoạch thiêng liêng do Chúa định sẵn.[150] Những nhân vật tiêu biểu góp phần làm nên tập quán này gồm sử gia Eusebius và Bêđa cùng nhà thần học Augustinô thành Hippo.[151] Ở thế giới Hồi giáo, chép sử cũng chịu ảnh hưởng tương tự từ tôn giáo, lấy góc nhìn Hồi giáo để diễn giải quá khứ. Sử luận Hồi giáo nhấn mạnh vào chuỗi truyền tin để bảo đảm độ tin cậy của tự sự lịch sử.[152] Al-Tabari là tác giả của một bộ sử ký công phu, kéo dài từ thuở khai thiên lập địa đến thời đại đương thời với ông. Ibn Khaldun phản tư các vấn đề nền tảng của chép sử về mặt triết lý, ví dụ như những quy luật phổ quát chi phối các tiến trình lịch sử cũng như giới hạn của chân lý lịch sử.[153]

Vào thời nhà Đường (618–907 CN) tại Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử ngày càng được thể chế hóa sâu hơn khi một cơ quan chuyên trách được thành lập năm 629 CN. Cơ quan này đã giám sát công tác biên soạn thực lục, những bộ ghi chép chi tiết làm nền tảng cho bộ chính sử quốc gia. Giới sử gia nhà Đường đề cao sự khác biệt giữa bản thân các sự kiện đã xảy ra và cách mà chúng được phản ánh trong các văn bản lịch sử.[154] Chép sử thời nhà Tống (960–1279 CN) diễn ra qua nhiều thể loại như bách khoa thư, tiểu sử và tiểu thuyết lịch sử, đồng thời lịch sử cũng trở thành một môn học chính trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc.[155] Tại Nhật Bản, một truyền thống chép sử riêng bắt đầu hình thành vào thế kỷ 8 CN, chịu ảnh hưởng từ mô hình Trung Hoa. Tương tự như ở Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử tại đây gắn bó mật thiết với hoàng thất nhưng các nhà sử học Nhật Bản ít chú trọng hơn vào đánh giá phê phán sử liệu.[156]

Đến thời Phục Hưng và cận đại (khoảng năm 1500 đến 1800), các truyền thống sử học dần trở nên gắn kết và ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau.[157] Từ thế kỷ 14 ở châu Âu, phong trào Phục Hưng đã đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ quan điểm tôn giáo đặc trưng của thời Trung Cổ sang mối quan tâm mới đối với di sản cổ điển Hy Lạp và La Mã. Các nhà nhân văn Phục Hưng sử dụng phương pháp phê phán sử liệu tinh vi nhằm xem xét lại những tác phẩm sử ký tôn giáo trước đây, qua đó góp phần thúc đẩy quá trình thế tục hóa trong ghi chép lịch sử. Từ thế kỷ 15 đến 17, giới sử học nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào vai trò mô phạm của lịch sử và sử dụng lịch sử như một công cụ để củng cố trật tự xã hội hiện có hoặc phục hồi lý tưởng về quá khứ. Khi máy in ép được phát minh, tài liệu viết trở nên dễ tiếp cận với chi phí phải chăng và việc tiếp nhận tri thức lịch sử dần được mở rộng ra bên ngoài giới giáo sĩ và quý tộc. Cùng lúc đó, tư tưởng hướng kinh nghiệm gắn với cuộc cách mạng khoa học đã làm dấy lên hoài nghi về khả năng đạt tới chân lý lịch sử phổ quát.[158] Trong thời kỳ Khai Sáng vào thế kỷ 18, ghi chép lịch sử chịu tác động mạnh mẽ từ chủ nghĩa duy lý và chủ nghĩa hoài nghi. Thời gian này, các nhà sử học tìm cách khai phá những quy luật và ý nghĩa sâu xa trong tiến trình lịch sử với mục đích thách thức quyền lực và giáo điều truyền thống bằng lý trí và phương pháp thực nghiệm. Ngoài ra, phạm vi của nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng được mở rộng thêm và tập trung ngày càng nhiều vào các đề tài xã hội và kinh tế cũng như so sánh các nền văn hóa khác nhau.[159]

Ở Trung Quốc thời nhà Minh (1368–1644), sự quan tâm của công chúng đối với các ấn phẩm ghi chép lịch sử gia tăng rõ rệt. Bên cạnh những công trình do sử quan biên soạn để tiếp nối thực lục của các triều đại trước, nhiều tác phẩm phi chính thức của các học giả tư nhân cũng phát triển mạnh. Những học giả này thường thể hiện phong cách sáng tạo hơn và đôi khi đưa ra diễn giải và tường thuật khác với chính thống.[160] Tại thế giới Hồi giáo, nhiều tập quán chép sử mới ra đời tại đế quốc Safavid, Mogul và Ottoman.[161] Trong khi đó tại châu Mỹ, các nhà thám hiểm châu Âu bắt đầu ghi lại và lý giải những tường thuật lịch sử của các dân tộc bản địa. Những câu chuyện này vốn được lưu truyền qua hình thức truyền miệng hoặc ký hiệu tượng hình và thường mang đến cách nhìn khác biệt so với quan điểm lịch sử của châu Âu đương thời.[162]

Leopold von Ranke đã cách mạng hóa tiêu chuẩn học thuật lịch sử nhờ cho ra đời quy trình đánh giá sử liệu sơ cấp kỹ lưỡng.[163]
Ghi chép lịch sử có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng chuyên nghiệp hóa và khoa học hóa vào thế kỷ 19. Sau công trình của Leopold von Ranke, một phương pháp phê phán sử liệu có hệ thống được thừa nhận rộng rãi và nhiều cơ sở học thuật chuyên về lịch sử như khoa ngành đại học, hiệp hội chuyên môn và tạp chí được thành lập.[164] Cùng với tinh thần khoa học của thời đại, Auguste Comte phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng và đặt ra mục tiêu khám phá những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử tương tự như với các định luật trong tự nhiên.[165] Dựa trên triết lý của Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx đã đề xuất một quy luật chung như vậy trong lý thuyết về chủ nghĩa duy vật lịch sử, cho rằng lực lượng kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp là nguyên nhân cơ bản dẫn đến thay đổi lịch sử.[166] Một bước phát triển quan trọng khác trong giai đoạn này là sự lan tỏa của các phương pháp sử luận châu Âu, vốn dần trở thành hướng tiếp cận chủ đạo trong nghiên cứu học thuật về quá khứ trên thế giới.[167]

Trong thế kỷ 20, những giả định và phương pháp lịch sử truyền thống dần bị đặt nghi vấn, còn tầm vực của nghiên cứu lịch sử tiếp tục được mở rộng.[168] Trường phái Annales kết hợp tri thức về xã hội học, tâm lý học và kinh tế học để nghiên cứu các tiến trình dài hạn.[169] Các chế độ chuyên chế như Đức Quốc Xã, Liên Xô và Trung Quốc thao túng tự sự lịch sử vì mục đích ý thức hệ.[170] Nhiều sử gia lựa chọn nghiên cứu với góc nhìn độc đáo, tập trung vào kinh nghiệm của các nhóm thiểu số xã hội qua những hướng tiếp cận như lịch sử từ dưới lên, lịch sử vi mô, lịch sử truyền miệng và sử học nữ quyền.[171] Chủ nghĩa hậu thực dân tìm cách phê phán và làm suy yếu sự bá chủ của cách tiếp cận phương Tây, còn chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại bác bỏ luận điểm về sự tồn tại một chân lý lịch sử phổ quát duy nhất.[172] Giới sử học trí thức khảo sát quá trình phát triển của các hệ tư tưởng trong lịch sử.[173] Đến nửa sau của thế kỷ, những nỗ lực mới trong biên soạn lịch sử thế giới với quy mô toàn cầu đã thu hút nhiều sự chú ý, trong khi các thành tựu công nghệ trở thành động lực cho sự phát triển của lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử.[174]

Ibn Khaldun là một nhân vật tiêu biểu trong sử luận Hồi giáo.[175]
Sử luận là nghiên cứu về các phương pháp và sự phát triển của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Nhà sử luận suy xét cách thức mà sử gia tiến hành nghiên cứu và viết sử, dẫn đến đây là một siêu lý thuyết dưới dạng lịch sử của lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ sử luận theo nghĩa khác để chỉ tường thuật được ghi chép về quá khứ.[176]

Một chủ đề cốt lõi trong sử luận dưới góc độ siêu lý thuyết tập trung vào chuẩn mực của bằng chứng và luận cứ trong khảo cứu lịch sử. Giới sử luận nghiên cứu và hệ thống hóa cách thức sử gia sử dụng tư liệu để xây dựng nên tự sự về quá khứ, trong đó có việc phân tích những giả thiết lý giải làm cơ sở cho quá trình xây dựng tự sự. Một số vấn đề khác có liên quan bao gồm văn phong và thủ pháp tu từ được trình bày trong các tác phẩm lịch sử.[177]

Qua việc so sánh công trình của các sử gia, giới sử luận có thể xác định trường phái tư tưởng dựa trên phương pháp nghiên cứu, giả định và phong cách chung.[178] Chẳng hạn, nhà sử luận khảo sát đặc trưng của trường phái Annales như việc sử dụng dữ liệu định lượng từ nhiều bộ môn hay mối quan tâm chủ yếu đến các quá trình kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn.[179] Sự so sánh còn mở rộng cho toàn thể thời kỳ từ cổ đại đến hiện đại. Bằng cách này, nhà sử luận có thể vạch ra tiến trình phát triển của lịch sử với tư cách một môn học thuật, từ đó cho thấy các phương pháp, đề tài và mục tiêu nghiên cứu chủ đạo đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.[180]

Bộ môn này quan tâm cả về bản thân quá khứ như là một chuỗi các sự kiện liên kết lẫn nhau và về lĩnh vực học thuật chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình đó. Những hiểu biết và cách tiếp cận từ một số phân nhánh triết học khác như siêu hình học, tri thức luận, thông diễn học và luân lý học có ảnh hưởng nhất định đến triết học lịch sử.[182]

Khi suy xét quá trình lịch sử, triết gia khám phá những thực thể cơ bản làm nên các hiện tượng lịch sử. Một số cách tiếp cận phụ thuộc chủ yếu vào niềm tin và hành động của cá nhân còn số khác bao hàm cả tập thể và các thực thể chung khác như văn minh, thiết chế, ý thức hệ và lực lượng xã hội.[183] Một chủ đề liên quan quan tâm bản chất của các cơ chế nhân quả liên kết những sự kiện lịch sử với nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng.[184] Một quan điểm cho rằng có những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử để xác định hướng tiếp diễn của sự kiện, tương tự như các định luật trong khoa học tự nhiên. Theo một góc nhìn khác, quan hệ nhân quả giữa các sự kiện lịch sử là duy nhất và được định hình bởi những yếu tố tùy cơ.[185] Trước đây, một số nhà triết học đã đưa ra luận cứ rằng hướng đi tổng quát của chiều dài lịch sử luôn tuân theo những quy luật lớn. Theo một luận điểm, lịch sử có tính tuần hoàn, tức là ở quy mô đủ lớn thì các sự kiện riêng lẻ hoặc xu hướng chung luôn lặp lại theo chu kỳ. Một lý thuyết khác khẳng định lịch sử là một quy trình tuyến tính có mục đích, đang chuyển động tới một mục tiêu xác định trước.[186][r]

Các chủ đề triết học lịch sử và sử luận có điểm tương đồng do chúng cùng quan tâm đến tiêu chuẩn của lý luận lịch sử. Nhà sử luận thường tập trung nhiều vào mô tả các phương pháp và tiến trình phát triển cụ thể trong nghiên cứu lịch sử. Trái lại, nhà triết học lịch sử có thiên hướng khám phá những quy luật tổng quát hơn, bao gồm đặt ra những câu hỏi đánh giá về việc phương pháp và giả thiết nào là đúng đắn.[188] Lý luận lịch sử đôi khi được vận dụng làm phương pháp giải thích hiện tượng trong triết học và các bộ môn khác. Phương pháp này, vốn hay gọi là chủ nghĩa lịch sử, lập luận rằng hiểu biết về một sự vật hay hiện tượng nào đó đòi hỏi phải nắm được bối cảnh lịch sử đặc thù hoặc quá trình tiến hóa của nó. Ví dụ, chủ nghĩa lịch sử về chân lý cho rằng chân lý phụ thuộc vào hoàn cảnh lịch sử, tức là không thể tồn tại chân lý xuyên lịch sử. Chủ nghĩa lịch sử tương phản với các hướng tiếp cận tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết vượt thời gian và phổ quát về chủ thể.[189]

Khách quan lịch sử
Nhiều tranh cãi trong triết học lịch sử xoay quanh khả năng tồn tại một tường thuật khách quan về lịch sử. Nhiều nhà lý thuyết nhận định lý tưởng đó là không thể đạt được và chỉ ra nguyên nhân nằm ở bản chất chủ quan trong cách lý giải sự kiện, khía cạnh tự sự của lịch sử cũng như ảnh hưởng của giá trị và thiên kiến cá nhân trong quan điểm và hành động của các nhân vật lịch sử và nhà sử học. Theo một góc nhìn, một số dữ kiện nhất định có tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như dữ kiện về thời điểm xảy ra hạn hán hoặc quân đội nào bị đánh bại. Song, góc nhìn này không đảm bảo tính khách quan tổng quát do sử gia vẫn phải lý giải và tổng hợp dữ kiện để đi đến một tự sự chung phản ánh các xu hướng và tiến trình phát triển lớn.[190] Vì vậy, một số nhà sử học như G. M. Trevelyan và Keith Jenkins đã khẳng định toàn bộ lịch sử đều có thiên kiến và cho rằng tự sự lịch sử không thể tách rời khỏi những giả định chủ quan và phán xét giá trị.[191]

Một số cách nhìn gắn với chủ nghĩa duy thực, chủ nghĩa kinh nghiệm và chủ nghĩa tái thiết[192] xem lịch sử là sự tìm kiếm chân lý hoặc tri thức, những gì mà chúng xem là có thể phục dựng được qua việc đánh giá nghiêm ngặt và diễn giải cẩn trọng các bằng chứng.[193][s] Nhiều học giả khác phê phán quan điểm đó, nhấn mạnh vào bản chất chủ quan và thiên vị của tri thức lịch sử.[t] Những nhà chủ nghĩa quan điểm cho rằng quan điểm lịch sử vốn dĩ đã có tính chủ quan do đòi hỏi phải chọn lọc sử liệu hay nghiên cứu cụ thể và xác định thông tin nào có thể coi là sự thật lịch sử. Họ lập luận mọi phát biểu chỉ có thể mang tính khách quan trong phạm vi nội tại hoặc khi xét tương đối với một trong nhiều góc nhìn lịch sử cạnh tranh lẫn nhau.[198] Một cách nhìn theo chủ nghĩa hoài nghi hoặc thuyết tương đối cực đoan hơn còn khẳng định không có tri thức lịch sử nào có thể được chứng tỏ là khách quan.[199][u] Sự nhấn mạnh về tính chủ quan đó đã được mở rộng trong các lý thuyết hậu hiện đại, vốn nhận định con người không thể nhận thức quá khứ một cách khách quan bởi ý nghĩa của lịch sử thực chất được kiến tạo qua văn bản do con người sáng tạo ra với ngôn ngữ "cấu thành nên thế giới theo cách mà chúng ta nhận thức nó".[201][v] Đáp lại xu hướng trên, các nhà tân duy thực khẳng định lại vai trò trung tâm của phương pháp luận kinh nghiệm trong phân tích lịch sử. Họ thừa nhận sức ảnh hưởng của đánh giá chủ quan nhưng tin rằng chân lý lịch sử vẫn có khả năng đạt tới được.[203][w]

Giáo dục

Lịch sử là môn bắt buộc tại trường học ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204]
Lịch sử là một bộ phận trong chương trình học tại trường phổ thông ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204] Giáo dục lịch sử giai đoạn đầu hướng tới khơi dậy sự hứng thú cho học sinh về quá khứ và giúp học sinh làm quen với các khái niệm cơ bản của tư tưởng lịch sử. Bằng việc xây dựng nhận thức lịch sử nền tảng, môn lịch sử hướng đến nuôi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc cá nhân và cộng đồng trên cơ sở hiểu biết về nguồn gốc văn hóa.[205] Môn học thường đi theo hình thức tự sự qua việc trình bày những câu chuyện đơn giản, tập trung vào các nhân vật lịch sử hoặc nguồn gốc của ngày lễ, lễ hội và tập quán địa phương.[206] Giáo dục lịch sử nâng cao ở trường trung học bao hàm phạm vi đề tài rộng hơn, từ lịch sử cổ đại đến hiện đại ở cả cấp độ địa phương và toàn cầu. Giai đoạn giáo dục này còn nhằm giúp học sinh làm quen với các phương pháp nghiên cứu lịch sử, bao gồm năng lực lý giải và đánh giá phê phán luận điểm lịch sử.[207]

Có nhiều phương pháp giảng dạy được giáo viên lịch sử áp dụng, bao gồm thuyết trình về các tiến trình phát triển lịch sử, đặt câu hỏi để tạo sự tương tác và kích thích tư duy phản biện, hoặc tổ chức thảo luận nhóm về các đề tài lịch sử. Học sinh làm việc trực tiếp với sử liệu để học cách phân tích và lý giải bằng chứng ở cả hình thức cá nhân và làm việc nhóm. Các em cũng tham gia ghi chép lịch sử để phát triển kỹ năng liên kết tư duy một cách rõ ràng và thuyết phục. Đánh giá qua kiểm tra viết hoặc vấn đáp được thực hiện nhằm đảm bảo đạt được các mục tiêu của môn học.[208] Phương pháp truyền thống trong giáo dục lịch sử thường là trình bày nhiều dữ kiện như ngày xảy ra sự kiện lớn và tên tuổi của các nhân vật lịch sử mà học sinh phải ghi nhớ. Ngược lại, một số cách tiếp cận hiện đại chú trọng khuyến khích tương tác tích cực và hiểu biết liên ngành sâu hơn về các quy luật tổng quát, tập trung vào cả những gì đã xảy ra, vì sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng đối với hiện tại.[209]

Giáo dục lịch sử ở trường công lập phục vụ nhiều mục đích. Một kỹ năng cốt lõi mà môn này hướng đến là năng lực lịch sử, tức khả năng lĩnh hội, phân tích phê phán và phản ứng trước diễn giải lịch sử. Bằng nhận thức về các tiến trình phát triển lớn trong quá khứ, học sinh có thể làm quen với nhiều bối cảnh của đời sống con người, từ đó hiểu rõ hơn thời đại mà mình đang sống cùng với các nền văn hóa đa dạng. Giáo dục lịch sử còn nhằm bồi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc văn hóa qua việc kết nối học sinh với các di sản, truyền thống và phong tục tập quán, chẳng hạn như giới thiệu về những yếu tố biểu tượng gồm di tích, tượng đài, nhân vật lịch sử và lễ hội.[210] Hiểu biết về quá khứ chung và di sản văn hóa có khả năng đóng góp cho sự hình thành bản sắc dân tộc và giúp học sinh sẵn sàng trở thành công dân tích cực. Khía cạnh chính trị này của giáo dục lịch sử có thể dẫn đến tranh cãi về việc nên đưa những chủ đề nào vào sách giáo khoa phổ thông và thậm chí đã từng gây ra cái gọi là chiến luận về lịch sử đối với chương trình học ở một số khu vực.[211] Yếu tố chính trị có khả năng làm các đề tài nhạy cảm bị diễn giải theo hướng thiên lệch nhằm củng cố hình ảnh di sản quốc gia một cách tích cực hơn so với thực tế.[212][x]

Giáo dục không chính quy qua triển lãm tạo tác lịch sử tại các bảo tàng là một bộ phận của lịch sử đại chúng.[214]
Ngoài giáo dục chính quy trong nhà trường, lịch sử còn được giảng dạy theo hình thức không chính quy ngoài lớp học. Lịch sử đại chúng được thể hiện tại những nơi như bảo tàng và khu tưởng niệm, trong đó thường chọn lọc một số hiện vật để chuyển tải những câu chuyện lịch sử cụ thể.[214] Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm lịch sử phổ biến, vốn có mục tiêu làm cho quá khứ trở nên hấp dẫn và dễ tiếp cận đến đối tượng khán giả rộng rãi và không chuyên trong các phương tiện truyền thông như sách, chương trình truyền hình hay nội dung trực tuyến.[215] Một phương tiện giáo dục lịch sử không chính quy khác là truyền thống truyền miệng với sự lưu truyền những tự sự về quá khứ qua nhiều thế hệ.[216]

Các lĩnh vực khác
Lịch sử sử dụng một phương pháp luận liên ngành dựa trên những phát kiến từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, địa chất học, di truyền học, nhân loại học và ngôn ngữ học.[217][y] Khảo cổ học nghiên cứu những tạo tác lịch sử do con người chế tạo và các hình thức văn hóa vật thể khác. Những phát hiện của giới khảo cổ mang lại hiểu biết quan trọng về các hoạt động của con người và quá trình phát triển văn hóa trong quá khứ.[219] Sự diễn giải bằng chứng khảo cổ đặt ra những thách thức riêng, khác biệt so với việc phân tích nhóm tác phẩm lịch sử thông thường ghi chép bằng chữ viết. Điều này đồng thời cũng mở ra những cơ hội mới từ việc trình bày thông tin chưa được ghi chép, cho phép sử gia tiếp cận quá khứ của những xã hội chưa có chữ viết và các nhóm thiểu số trong xã hội có chữ viết qua sự nghiên cứu di tích văn hóa vật chất. Trước khi khảo cổ học hiện đại xuất hiện vào thế kỷ 19, nghiên cứu đồ cổ là nền tảng ban đầu của bộ môn này và đóng vai trò chủ yếu trong bảo tồn tạo tác lịch sử.[220]

Địa chất học và các môn khoa học Trái Đất khác giúp sử gia hiểu được bối cảnh môi trường và các quá trình vật lý ảnh hưởng đến xã hội trong quá khứ, bao gồm điều kiện khí hậu, cảnh quan và hiện tượng tự nhiên.[221] Di truyền học cung cấp thông tin then chốt về nguồn gốc tiến hóa của loài người, di dân, tổ tiên và biến đổi nhân khẩu học.[222] Nhân loại học tìm hiểu văn hóa và hành vi của con người với các khía cạnh như cơ cấu xã hội, hệ tín ngưỡng và thực hành nghi lễ, mang đến cơ sở tri thức cho việc lý giải sự kiện lịch sử.[223] Ngôn ngữ học lịch sử nghiên cứu sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ theo thời gian, có vai trò cần thiết khi cần diễn giải văn bản cổ đại và đồng thời cũng cung cấp thông tin về quy luật di dân và trao đổi văn hóa.[224] Giới sử học còn sử dụng bằng chứng từ các lĩnh vực khác thuộc khoa học vật lý, khoa học sinh học và khoa học xã hội cùng với nhân văn học.[225]

Do có liên quan đến ý thức hệ và bản sắc dân tộc, lịch sử có quan hệ gần gũi với chính trị và những lý thuyết lịch sử có thể tác động trực tiếp đến quyết định chính trị. Chẳng hạn, việc một nước cố gắng sáp nhập lãnh thổ của nước khác theo chủ nghĩa phục hồi lãnh thổ thường có nguyên nhân nằm ở các lý thuyết lịch sử cho rằng vùng lãnh thổ tranh chấp đó thuộc về nước đầu tiên trong quá khứ.[226] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò trọng tâm ở cái gọi là tôn giáo lịch sử, vốn đặt nền tảng giáo lý của mình trên những sự kiện lịch sử. Ví dụ, Kitô giáo thường được phân loại là tôn giáo lịch sử do tập trung vào các sự kiện xoay quanh Chúa Giê-su.[227] Lịch sử còn có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực khác thông qua nghiên cứu về quá khứ của chính những lĩnh vực đó như lịch sử khoa học, toán học, triết học và nghệ thuật.[228]

Ghi chú
^ Một số nhà lý thuyết xác định thời sơ sử là một giai đoạn riêng biệt sau thời tiền sử, kéo dài từ lúc chữ viết được phát minh đến khi xuất hiện những bản chép sử đầu tiên.[6]
^ Lịch sử Vĩ đại (Big History) do nhà sử học David Christian xây dựng vào cuối thập niên 1980 có phạm vi trải dài đến Vụ Nổ Lớn, bao hàm sự phát triển vũ trụ và quá trình tiến hóa sinh học của sự sống bên cạnh lịch sử thế giới.[9]
^ Các sử gia thời kỳ đầu như Herodotos và Thucydides đã coi tự sự của Homeros cùng những nhà thơ khác là không tưởng và không chính xác.[14]
^ Một cách nhìn có liên quan là chủ nghĩa xét lại lịch sử, vốn nhằm lật lại những quan điểm đã được củng cố về lịch sử. Xét lại lịch sử gồm nhiều dạng, từ đưa ra bằng chứng và phương pháp mới chống lại tư duy hiện tại đến chỉ trích giá trị hoặc tầm quan trọng của các sự kiện hoặc nhân vật lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ chủ nghĩa xét lại theo nghĩa trung lập để chỉ bất kỳ sự bác bỏ hoặc diễn giải lại luận điểm chính thống. Số khác cho rằng thuật ngữ gắn với việc làm bỏ qua bằng chứng xác thực và kết hợp các quan niệm tương đối hoặc hoài nghi một cách cực đoan để biện minh góc nhìn ngụy sử, cố ý làm suy giảm uy tín của tri thức đã được khẳng định về các sự kiện lịch sử thông qua phê phán tri thức luận.[21]
^ Hiểu theo nghĩa hẹp, phương pháp lịch sử đôi khi chỉ bao gồm việc đánh giá hoặc phê phán sử liệu.[29]
^ Định nghĩa chính xác về nguồn sơ cấp và nguồn thứ cấp là vấn đề còn tranh cãi. Việc một nguồn tư liệu cụ thể được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp không phải lúc nào cũng có sự thống nhất. Ví dụ, trong trường hợp một người không xuất hiện trong một cuộc bạo loạn nhưng đưa tin về vụ việc đó ngay sau khi xảy ra, một số nhà sử học xem tin bài đó là nguồn sơ cấp còn số khác xem đó là nguồn thứ cấp.[37]
^ Quan niệm lấy đánh giá sử liệu làm trọng tâm của Leopold von Ranke có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến nghiên cứu lịch sử.[40]
^ Bối cảnh và thời điểm xuất bản tài liệu thường được xét đến để hiểu được nghĩa của các thuật ngữ mà tài liệu đang sử dụng. Chẳng hạn, nếu một tài liệu tiếng Anh dùng từ awful, sử gia phải xác định xem từ này thể hiện nghĩa hiện đại 'tồi tệ' hay nghĩa cũ 'đáng kinh ngạc'.[42]
^ Điều này trở nên đặc biệt khó khăn nếu các sử liệu khác nhau đưa ra thông tin dường như mâu thuẫn nhau.[44]
^ Sự sáng tạo và trí tưởng tượng cần có cho bước này là một trong những lý do khiến một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn nghệ thuật thay vì là một môn khoa học.[45]
^ Chẳng hạn, Martha Washington đốt toàn bộ thư từ giữa bà với chồng George Washington, để lại khoảng trống kéo dài hàng chục năm về mối quan hệ giữa hai người.[52] Sự tồn tại cấm kỵ (ví dụ như cấm kỵ đồng tính luyến ái) là một nguyên nhân khác gây ra khoảng trống, có thể dẫn đến hiện tượng có ít thông tin về chủ đề được ghi lại.[51] Thông lệ xóa tên người đã mất bị xem là kẻ thù khỏi ghi chép công khai được gọi là damnatio memoriae.[53]
^ Có nhiều bất đồng về thời điểm bắt đầu và kết thúc chính xác của mỗi thời kỳ. Các cách phân kỳ khác có thể lấy những khoảng thời gian chồng chéo nhau hoặc khác biệt nhiều so với thông thường.[64]
^ Những căn bệnh mới cùng với sự xâm lược và bóc lột quân sự từ châu Âu đã gây ra mất mát lớn về nhân mạng và dẫn đến sự gián đoạn văn hóa trong các cộng đồng bản địa ở châu Mỹ cũng như một số hậu quả nghiêm trọng khác.[74]
^ Nhấn mạnh mối quan hệ mật thiết giữa địa lý và lịch sử, Jules Michelet viết trong lời nói đầu cuốn Histoire de France năm 1869: "không có cơ sở địa lý, con người, những người làm nên lịch sử, dường như đang quá hạnh phúc".[80]
^ Herodotos thường được xem là "cha đẻ của lịch sử" nhưng cũng bị gọi là "cha đẻ của dối trá" bởi không phải mọi tự sự của ông đều đáng tin.[141]
^ Khía cạnh này cũng có thể thấy ở một mức độ nào đó trong những tác phẩm của các sử gia Hy Lạp như Herodotos và Polybius.[144]
^ Lý thuyết lịch sử là một thuật ngữ có liên hệ mật thiết đôi lúc được dùng làm từ đồng nghĩa.[181]
^ Một số triết gia có luận điểm tương tự như Francis Fukuyama rằng "hồi kết của lịch sử" đã đến dựa trên tuyên bố cho rằng quá trình tiến triển ý thức hệ của loài người đã đạt đến cực hạn.[187]
^ Nhà sử học người Đức Leopold von Ranke là một trong những người đề xướng quan trọng nhất của cách tiếp cận khoa học này vào thế kỷ 19.[194] Sir Geoffrey Elton, Arthur Marwick và E. P. Thompson là ba trong số những học giả thời hiện đại tán thành với góc nhìn trên.[193]
^ Những phê phán này dựa trên một số luận cứ như: việc phục dựng toàn bộ quá khứ là bất khả; khi sự kiện đã trôi qua, không thể kiểm chứng tường thuật so với sự kiện mà chỉ có thể kiểm chứng so với tường thuật khác; ghi chép lịch sử do sử gia nối kết và xây dựng, và quá trình tạo lập tự sự bao gồm lý giải và đọc hiểu có chọn lọc;[195] tự thân bằng chứng cũng là chủ quan một cách tất yếu do nội dung trong bằng chứng được nối kết thông qua người tạo ra nó và sự tồn tại qua các quá trình chọn lọc.[196] Từ góc nhìn này, nhận thức muộn và lý thuyết hóa hiện đại cũng cho phép sử gia kết hợp bằng chứng và đưa ra lý giải vốn chỉ có thể thấy được sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra dưới góc độ thiên lệch, tức là lịch sử dưới hình thức quá khứ đã biết là sản phẩm do con người tạo ra.[197]
^ Trong những người đề xướng quan điểm theo thiên hướng thuyết tương đối có E. H. Carr, tác giả của What Is History? (1961) vốn khảo sát tác động từ bối cảnh lịch sử và xã hội đến cách lựa chọn và phân tích dữ kiện của giới sử học.[200]
^ Một số học giả cho rằng việc nhận diện bản chất chủ quan của tư liệu lịch sử là cơ hội để mở ra các lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và phương pháp mới trong làm việc với chủ thể lịch sử; đồng thời cũng mang lại những hướng tiếp cận mới trong phân tích sử liệu, phê phán tự sự chính thống và cho phép nhà sử học làm việc với nhiều khái niệm khác nhau.[202]
^ Richard J. Evans là một trong số những học giả ủng hộ quan điểm này.[203]
^ Chẳng hạn, một số sách giáo khoa lịch sử cấp trung học phổ thông của Nhật Bản đã bị chỉ trích do cố ý hạ thấp những hoạt động thực dân và tham chiến của nước này.[213]
^ Chúng đôi khi được gộp lại thành một nhóm có tên khoa học phụ trợ của lịch sử.[218]

Lịch sử là nghiên cứu có hệ thống về quá khứ, tập trung chủ yếu vào quá khứ của loài người. Dưới hình thức một môn học, lịch sử phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng để tường thuật lại những gì đã xảy ra và giải thích lý do cũng như cách thức mà sự việc đó xảy ra. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội còn số khác xem đây là bộ phận của nhân văn học hoặc là một bộ môn hỗn hợp. Có nhiều tranh luận tương tự xoay quanh mục đích của lịch sử, chẳng hạn như liệu mục tiêu chính của nó là để khám phá chân lý (hướng lý thuyết) hay là rút ra bài học kinh nghiệm từ quá khứ (hướng thực tiễn). Theo cách hiểu suy rộng, ngoài ý nghĩa lĩnh vực học thuật, thuật ngữ lịch sử còn chỉ cả bản thân quá khứ, những thời điểm trong quá khứ hoặc các văn bản riêng lẻ liên quan đến quá khứ.

Nghiên cứu lịch sử phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tư liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp để tái hiện các sự kiện trong quá khứ và xác nhận diễn giải. Phê phán sử liệu là một phương pháp được sử dụng để đánh giá những nguồn này dựa trên tính xác thực, nội dung và độ tin cậy. Giới sử học thường cố gắng kết hợp quan điểm giữa nhiều nguồn tài liệu để tạo nên mạch tự sự thống nhất. Các trường phái tư tưởng khác nhau như chủ nghĩa thực chứng, trường phái Annales, chủ nghĩa Marx và chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại có cách tiếp cận phương pháp luận khác nhau.

Lịch sử là một bộ môn rộng bao gồm nhiều nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào các giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể (ví dụ như thời kỳ cổ đại), còn số khác hướng đến những khu vực địa lý nhất định (chẳng hạn như lịch sử châu Phi). Theo phạm vi lĩnh vực, lịch sử có thể được phân loại thành lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử quân sự, lịch sử xã hội, lịch sử kinh tế, v.v. Các phân nhánh theo loại tư liệu và phương pháp nghiên cứu bao gồm lịch sử định lượng, lịch sử so sánh và lịch sử truyền miệng.

Lịch sử ra đời dưới hình thức lĩnh vực nghiên cứu ở thời cổ đại thay thế những câu chuyện truyền thuyết, bắt nguồn chủ yếu ở Hy Lạp, Trung Quốc và sau này là thế giới Hồi giáo. Ghi chép lịch sử trải qua nhiều biến đổi theo thời gian và ngày càng có tính chuyên nghiệp cao, nhất là vào thế kỷ 19 với sự xuất hiện một phương pháp luận nghiêm ngặt cùng hàng loạt cơ sở học thuật được thành lập. Lịch sử có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực như sử luận, triết học, giáo dục và chính trị.

Định nghĩa
Theo sử gia Đào Duy Anh (1932), lịch sử (ánh xạ với tiếng Pháp histoire) được định nghĩa là "biên chép những sự biến thiên diên cách trải qua các đời" hoặc "biên chép những việc lớn của quốc gia, xã hội".[1]

Dưới dạng một bộ môn học thuật, lịch sử là ngành nghiên cứu về quá khứ, đặc biệt là quá khứ của loài người.[2] Mục tiêu của lịch sử là khái quát và tái hiện những gì đã xảy ra bằng cách thu thập và phân tích các bằng chứng để tổng hợp thành tường thuật. Những tường thuật này làm sáng tỏ diễn biến vụ việc, nguyên nhân hình thành và bối cảnh lịch sử cụ thể, qua đó giải thích điều kiện bối cảnh và cơ chế nhân quả liên quan đến chúng. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn phân tích ý nghĩa của những sự việc trong quá khứ và khám phá những động cơ đã thúc đẩy hành động của con người.[3]

Theo một định nghĩa khác, lịch sử chỉ bản thân các sự kiện trong quá khứ. Theo cách hiểu này, lịch sử chính là những gì đã xảy ra thay vì là môn học thuật nghiên cứu những điều đã xảy ra. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn có một nghĩa khác là ghi chép về quá khứ dưới hình thức văn bản. Văn bản lịch sử là sản phẩm văn hóa phản ánh quá trình lý giải và tái cấu trúc thường xuyên từ các nhà sử học. Cách tường thuật trong các văn bản lịch sử có thể thay đổi khi nhà sử học tìm thấy bằng chứng mới hoặc lý giải lại sử liệu hiện có. Trái lại, bản thân quá khứ là bất biến và không thể thay đổi.[4] Một số sử gia tập trung vào các khía cạnh lý giải và giải thích để phân biệt lịch sử với biên niên sử, với luận điểm rằng biên niên sử chỉ liệt kê các sự kiện theo trình tự thời gian còn lịch sử hướng đến hiểu biết toàn diện về nguyên nhân, bối cảnh đến hệ quả.[5]

Từ trước đến nay, lịch sử chủ yếu nghiên cứu những gì được con người ghi lại bằng chữ viết. Vì thế, môn này tập trung vào các sự kiện xảy ra sau khi con người phát minh ra chữ viết (gọi là lịch sử ghi chép), còn thời kỳ trước đó, gọi là thời tiền sử,[a] thường do ngành khảo cổ học nghiên cứu.[7] Tuy nhiên, sang thế kỷ 20, các nhà sử học đã mở rộng phạm vi và bắt đầu quan tâm nhiều hơn đến quá khứ của loài người trước thời điểm chữ viết ra đời.[8][b]

Giới sử học tranh luận về việc lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội hay là bộ phận của nhân văn học. Tương tự như với khoa học xã hội, nhà sử học xây dựng giả thuyết, thu thập bằng chứng khách quan và trình bày luận điểm dựa trên bằng chứng đó. Mặt khác, lịch sử cũng liên hệ chặt chẽ với nhân văn học vì phụ thuộc vào các khía cạnh chủ quan gắn liền với sự lý giải, kể chuyện, kinh nghiệm của con người và di sản văn hóa.[10] Một số sử gia ủng hộ phân loại theo chỉ một trong hai cách nêu trên, còn số khác xem lịch sử là một môn hỗn hợp không thuộc về phạm trù cụ thể nào theo hướng loại trừ với phạm trù còn lại.[11] Lịch sử đối lập với ngụy sử, một thuật ngữ chỉ sử luận lệch chuẩn do dùng bằng chứng lịch sử gây tranh cãi, cố tình bỏ qua bằng chứng đã xác thực hoặc sử dụng cách thức khác để bóp méo ghi chép lịch sử. Thường được thúc đẩy bởi một số ý thức hệ nhất định, ngụy sử bắt chước phương pháp lịch sử để truyền bá cách tường thuật thiên lệch, gây hiểu lầm, không dựa trên phân tích nghiêm ngặt và thiếu sự đồng thuận về mặt học thuật.[12]

Mục đích
Đã có nhiều ý kiến được đưa ra về mục đích hoặc giá trị của lịch sử. Một số sử gia cho rằng mục đích chính của lịch sử chỉ đơn giản là tìm ra chân lý về quá khứ. Theo quan điểm này, mưu cầu chân lý công tâm là một mục đích tự thân và không nên bị ảnh hưởng bởi những mục đích bên ngoài như chính trị hay ý thức hệ, vì như vậy có thể xuyên tạc quá khứ và ảnh hưởng xấu đến độ chính xác của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Khi đóng vai trò đi tìm chân lý, lịch sử còn có nhiệm vụ làm sáng tỏ những câu chuyện truyền miệng hay thần thoại đã tồn tại từ lâu nhưng thiếu bằng chứng xác thực.[13][c]

Một góc nhìn khác cho rằng giá trị cốt lõi của lịch sử nằm ở những bài học kinh nghiệm để lại cho nhân loại ngày nay. Ý tưởng ở đây là hiểu rõ quá khứ sẽ giúp con người ra quyết định tốt hơn, chẳng hạn như để tránh lặp lại sai lầm của quá khứ.[15] Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn giúp ta hiểu về bản chất con người. Trong những bối cảnh và thời đại khác nhau, con người sẽ cư xử khác đi, giống như việc người ta du lịch để học hỏi về các nền văn hóa mới vậy.[16] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò là chất keo gắn kết xã hội. Khi nhiều người có chung một quá khứ, họ hình thành một bản sắc tập thể vững chắc, nhờ đó các di sản và giá trị văn hóa được bảo tồn và lưu truyền qua nhiều thế hệ.[17] Đối với một số học giả, bao gồm giới sử gia Whig và học giả Mác-xít E. H. Carr, lịch sử là chìa khóa để am hiểu hiện tại[18] và (theo Carr) định hình tương lai.[19]

Lịch sử đôi lúc cũng được sử dụng làm công cụ chính trị và công cụ tuyên truyền, ví dụ như ca ngợi những truyền thống cũ nhằm giúp giới cầm quyền duy trì hiện trạng hoặc phơi bày những bất công trong quá khứ để thúc đẩy thay đổi.[20] Ở dạng cực đoan, người ta cố ý bỏ qua hoặc xuyên tạc bằng chứng để tạo ra những câu chuyện hoàn toàn sai lệch, dẫn đến ngụy sử hoặc xuyên tạc lịch sử.[12][d] Một số ví dụ tiêu biểu gồm phủ nhận sự tồn tại của nạn diệt chủng Holocaust, diệt chủng Armenia, thảm sát Nam Kinh và Holodomor.[22]

Từ lịch sử trong tiếng Việt là cách đọc Hán-Việt của hai chữ 歷史 (lìshǐ).[1]

Từ history trong tiếng Anh bắt nguồn từ chữ Hy Lạp cổ ἵστωρ (histōr) tức 'người có học, thông thái'. Từ này phái sinh từ Hy Lạp cổ ἱστορία (historiā), vốn mang nghĩa rộng gắn với tra vấn nói chung và đưa ra lời chứng. Thuật ngữ sau đó được chuyển tự sang tiếng Latinh cổ điển thành historia. Vào thời Hy Lạp hóa và La Mã, ý nghĩa của thuật ngữ có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào khía cạnh tường thuật và nghệ thuật trình bày thay vì nghiên cứu và lời chứng.[24]

Từ history du nhập vào tiếng Anh trung đại vào thế kỷ 14 thông qua chữ histoire của tiếng Pháp cổ.[25] Lúc bấy giờ, nó có nghĩa là 'câu chuyện, truyện kể', gồm cả tường thuật có thật và hư cấu. Vào thế kỷ 15, nghĩa của từ này thay đổi theo hướng bao hàm nhánh tri thức nghiên cứu quá khứ đi đôi với tự sự về quá khứ.[26] Đến thế kỷ 18 và 19, chữ history dần liên hệ chặt chẽ hơn với tường thuật thực tế và tra vấn dựa trên bằng chứng cùng thời điểm với giai đoạn chuyên nghiệp hóa của nghiên cứu lịch sử, một ý nghĩa hiện còn mang tính chi phối trong cách dùng từ đương đại.[27] Ý nghĩa bao hàm cả truyện kể đơn thuần và tự sự có thật về quá khứ cũng hiện diện trong thuật ngữ lịch sử ở nhiều ngôn ngữ châu Âu khác như histoire (tiếng Pháp), storia (tiếng Ý) và Geschichte (tiếng Đức).[28]

Phương pháp
Bài chi tiết: Phương pháp lịch sử
Phương pháp lịch sử là một tập hợp các kỹ thuật mà giới sử học áp dụng để nghiên cứu và lý giải quá khứ, bao gồm các quy trình thu thập, đánh giá và tổng hợp chứng cứ.[e] Phương pháp lịch sử nhằm đảm bảo tính nghiêm ngặt, chính xác và độ tin cậy học thuật về cách lựa chọn, phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng lịch sử.[30] Nghiên cứu lịch sử thường bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi nghiên cứu để xác định phạm vi đề tài. Một số câu hỏi nghiên cứu tập trung đơn thuần vào mô tả những gì đã xảy ra, trong khi số khác hướng đến giải thích lý do một sự kiện cụ thể xảy ra, bác bỏ giả thuyết đã có hoặc xác nhận một giả thuyết mới.[31]

Sử liệu và phê phán sử liệu
Để giải đáp câu hỏi nghiên cứu, các sử gia sử dụng nhiều loại bằng chứng khác nhau để tái hiện lại quá khứ và củng cố cho kết luận của mình. Bằng chứng lịch sử thường được chia thành nguồn sơ cấp và thứ cấp.[32] Nguồn sơ cấp là những thứ được hình thành ngay trong thời kỳ đó. Có nhiều loại nguồn sơ cấp như tài liệu chính thức, thư từ, nhật ký, lời kể của nhân chứng, ảnh chụp, bản ghi âm hoặc ghi hình. Tư liệu sơ cấp còn bao gồm dấu tích lịch sử được tìm thấy qua khảo cổ học, địa chất học và y khoa, ví dụ như hiện vật và hóa thạch lấy từ các cuộc khai quật. Nguồn sơ cấp cho ta bằng chứng trực tiếp nhất về các sự kiện quá khứ.[33]

Nguồn thứ cấp là tư liệu phân tích hoặc lý giải thông tin của tư liệu khác.[35] Việc một nguồn tài liệu được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp phụ thuộc cả vào bản chất lẫn mục đích sử dụng của tư liệu đó. Chẳng hạn, tài liệu nghiên cứu về chế độ nô lệ được viết bằng cách phân tích các tài liệu lịch sử sẽ là nguồn thứ cấp khi nói về chế độ nô lệ nhưng lại là nguồn sơ cấp về quan điểm của sử gia đó.[36][f] Một trong những tiêu chuẩn phải có của một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử đáng tin cậy là tính nhất quán với các tư liệu đã có. Nếu các nhà sử học tìm thấy những nguồn tài liệu mới, họ có thể sẽ phải sửa đổi hoặc bác bỏ những câu chuyện lịch sử đã và đang được công nhận.[38] Để tìm kiếm và tiếp cận với sử liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp, các sử gia thường tra cứu kho lưu trữ, thư viện và bảo tàng. Kho lưu trữ đóng vai trò chủ chốt qua việc lưu lại và công khai vô số tư liệu nguyên bản đến giới nghiên cứu một cách có hệ thống và dễ tiếp cận. Nhờ những tiến bộ công nghệ, giới sử học đang ngày càng tận dụng nguồn tài nguyên trực tuyến với các cơ sở dữ liệu phong phú cùng những kỹ thuật tìm kiếm và truy cập tài liệu.[39]

Phê phán sử liệu là quá trình phân tích và đánh giá thông tin mà một tư liệu cung cấp.[g] Thông thường, quá trình này bắt đầu bằng phê phán ngoại tại, tức là đánh giá tính xác thực của sử liệu bằng cách đặt ra những câu hỏi như sử liệu này ra đời khi nào, ở đâu, ai là tác giả, mục đích người đó làm ra sử liệu là gì, sử liệu có từng bị chỉnh sửa gì sau thời điểm xuất bản hay không. Ngoài ra, phê phán ngoại tại còn bao gồm phân biệt giữa bản gốc, bản sao và bản làm giả.[41]

Phê phán nội tại là đánh giá nội dung của tư liệu, thường bắt đầu bằng việc làm rõ ý nghĩa những gì tư liệu muốn nói. Việc này bao gồm làm rõ nghĩa những từ ngữ có thể gây nhầm lẫn, hoặc nếu tài liệu viết bằng một ngôn ngữ lạ thì cần phải dịch nó ra.[h] Khi đã hiểu nội dung, bước quan trọng nhất là xác định tính chính xác: thông tin có đáng tin không, có bị bóp méo hay trình bày sai sự thật không, có đầy đủ không, có bỏ sót chi tiết quan trọng nào không. Một cách tiến hành những việc trên là đánh giá khả năng trình bày trung thực sự kiện được nghiên cứu của tác giả về mặt nguyên tắc. Ngoài ra, còn có một số phương pháp tiếp cận khác như đánh giá tầm ảnh hưởng của ý định hay thiên kiến từ tác giả và tham chiếu thông tin với các nguồn đáng tin cậy khác. Nhận biết về thiếu sót của sử liệu giúp các nhà sử học quyết định có nên tin tưởng sử liệu đó hay không, nếu có thì nên tin những khía cạnh gì và nên sử dụng nó như thế nào để xây dựng tường thuật.[43]

Tổng hợp lịch sử và các trường phái tư tưởng
Từ bước lựa chọn, phân tích và phê phán sử liệu, sử gia sẽ xác minh được một lượng lớn các luận điểm độc lập về quá khứ. Ở bước tiếp theo, đôi khi còn gọi là tổng hợp lịch sử, nhà sử học sẽ tìm hiểu cách thức liên kết những bằng chứng riêng lẻ đó thành một bức tranh tổng thể.[i] Việc xây dựng góc nhìn bao quát là cần thiết để có sự hiểu biết toàn diện về đề tài nghiên cứu. Đây là một khía cạnh sáng tạo[j] của ghi chép lịch sử nhằm tái hiện và lý giải những gì đã xảy ra thông qua việc xác định mối liên hệ giữa nhiều sự kiện khác nhau.[46] Nhờ đó, sử gia có thể xác định được những sự kiện nào đã diễn ra, nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng là gì.[47] Tuy không có kỹ thuật duy nhất nào được chấp nhận rộng rãi, giới sử học vẫn áp dụng nhiều công cụ và cách tiếp cận diễn giải trong quá trình trên.[48]

Auguste Comte là người phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng, ủng hộ tiếp cận lịch sử trên cơ sở khoa học.[49]
Một công cụ giúp khái quát và trình bày dễ hiểu các quá trình phát triển phức tạp là phân kỳ lịch sử, tức là chia một khoảng thời gian thành nhiều giai đoạn riêng biệt, mỗi giai đoạn được xác định bởi một chủ đề hoặc quá trình phát triển chủ đạo. Ví dụ, hệ thống ba thời đại thường được sử dụng để phân chia lịch sử loài người thuở đầu thành thời đại đồ đá, thời đại đồ đồng và thời đại đồ sắt dựa trên loại nguyên vật liệu và công nghệ chủ yếu đặc trưng cho từng thời kỳ.[50] Một phương pháp khác là nghiên cứu khoảng trống trong ghi chép lịch sử, tức những sự kiện đã từng xảy ra nhưng không để lại bằng chứng đáng kể nào. Những khoảng trống này có thể xuất hiện khi người đương thời cho rằng thông tin quá hiển nhiên nên không cần ghi lại, hoặc khi thông tin bị cố ý giấu giếm hay tiêu hủy.[51][k] Ngược lại, khi có sẵn các tập dữ liệu lớn thì sử gia có thể sử dụng hướng tiếp cận định lượng. Chẳng hạn, các nhà sử học kinh tế và xã hội thường áp dụng phương pháp phân tích thống kê để nhận diện quy luật và xu hướng trong phạm vi tập thể rộng lớn.[54]

Mỗi trường phái tư tưởng có quan điểm riêng về mặt phương pháp luận trong ghi chép lịch sử.[55] Những nhà sử học theo chủ nghĩa thực chứng xem nghiên cứu lịch sử là một hoạt động mang tính khoa học và cho rằng bằng chứng thực nghiệm đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tìm kiếm chân lý khách quan.[56] Trái lại, các nhà hậu hiện đại phủ nhận tính hợp lệ của những đại tự sự vốn được cho là mang lại một chân lý khách quan duy nhất. Chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại thay vào đó đề cao bản chất chủ quan của lý giải lịch sử và xem đây là nền tảng cho sự đa dạng của các quan điểm lịch sử khác nhau.[57] Những nhà Mác-xít cho rằng mọi sự phát triển lịch sử đều bắt nguồn từ động lực kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp.[58] Trường phái Annales tập trung nghiên cứu các xu hướng kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn, lấy những phương pháp định lượng và tiếp cận liên ngành làm trọng tâm.[59] Sử học nữ quyền nghiên cứu vai trò của giới tính xã hội trong lịch sử, đặc biệt quan tâm đến việc phân tích kinh nghiệm của phụ nữ và phê phán các quan niệm mang tính phụ quyền trong chép sử truyền thống.[60]

Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu
Lịch sử là một lĩnh vực nghiên cứu rộng bao gồm nhiều phân nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào một giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể còn số khác tập trung vào một khu vực địa lý hoặc đề tài nhất định. Một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử thường có thể có sự kết hợp nhiều hướng chuyên môn khác nhau; chẳng hạn, một tác phẩm về lịch sử kinh tế ở Ai Cập cổ đại có sự tổng hợp các góc nhìn về mặt thời gian, không gian và chủ đề. Đối với đề tài phạm vi rộng, lượng sử liệu sơ cấp liên quan thường quá lớn để có thể khảo cứu hết, buộc sử gia phải thu hẹp tầm vực chủ đề nghiên cứu hoặc sử dụng thêm tài liệu thứ cấp để đi đến kết luận tổng quan.[61]

Theo giai đoạn
Phân chia theo trình tự thời gian là một cách tiếp cận thường gặp để sắp xếp tiến trình lịch sử rộng lớn thành nhiều phân đoạn. Việc xác định các thời kỳ thường dựa trên những đặc trưng nổi bật của một giai đoạn nhất định cùng với các sự kiện quan trọng đánh dấu sự khởi đầu hoặc kết thúc những bước phát triển đó. Tùy vào bối cảnh nghiên cứu và mức độ chi tiết mà một thời kỳ có thể kéo dài từ vài thập kỷ đến hàng thế kỷ.[62] Một hướng tiếp cận tiêu biểu là chia lịch sử thế giới thành thời tiền sử, thời kỳ cổ đại, thời kỳ trung đại, thời kỳ cận đại và thời kỳ hiện đại.[63][l] Tuy nhiên, tùy theo khu vực và chủ đề nghiên cứu mà có thể có sự khác biệt về ranh giới thời gian giữa các thời kỳ trên và giới sử học cũng có thể sử dụng cách phân kỳ hoàn toàn khác.[65] Chẳng hạn, lịch sử Trung Quốc thường được phân kỳ theo các triều đại chính,[66] trong khi lịch sử châu Mỹ lại thường được chia theo các giai đoạn tiền Colombo, thực dân và hậu thực dân.[67]

Các nhà sử học sử dụng bằng chứng từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau để nghiên cứu thời tiền sử, bao gồm cả hóa thạch như Lucy.[68]
Nghiên cứu thời tiền sử bao gồm khảo sát quá trình tiến hóa của các loài người cổ cách đây vài triệu năm, dẫn đến sự xuất hiện của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu khoảng 200.000 năm trước.[69] Thời gian sau đó, loài người dần di cư khỏi châu Phi để cư trú ở hầu khắp Trái Đất. Về cuối thời tiền sử, những tiến bộ về công nghệ (nhất là trong chế tác công cụ) đã khiến nhiều cộng đồng người từ bỏ lối sống du mục quen thuộc dựa vào săn bắt và hái lượm và chuyển sang lối sống ít vận động dựa trên những hoạt động nông nghiệp sơ khai.[70] Sự thiếu vắng tài liệu thành văn từ thời kỳ này để lại nhiều thách thức đối với các nhà nghiên cứu và là nền tảng để cho ra đời một phương pháp tiếp cận liên ngành trên cơ sở tổng hợp những dạng bằng chứng khác từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, nhân loại học, cổ sinh vật học và địa chất học.[71]

Giới sử gia nghiên cứu thời cổ đại khảo sát sự hình thành các nền văn minh lớn đầu tiên ở những khu vực như Lưỡng Hà, Ai Cập, lưu vực sông Ấn, Trung Quốc và Peru, bắt đầu từ khoảng năm 3500 TCN tại một số nơi. Những biến đổi phức tạp trong xã hội, kinh tế và chính trị đã tạo điều kiện cho việc phát triển các hệ thống chữ viết đầu tiên. Nhờ những thành tựu mới về nông nghiệp, lượng lương thực thặng dư đã giúp các nền văn minh trên nuôi sống được quy mô dân số ngày càng lớn, kéo theo quá trình đô thị hóa, sự thành lập nhiều mạng lưới thương mại và sự xuất hiện những đế chế khu vực. Ở giai đoạn sau của thời cổ đại, đôi khi còn gọi là thời kỳ cổ điển, các xã hội tại Trung Quốc, Ấn Độ, Ba Tư và Địa Trung Hải tiếp tục mở rộng và đạt đến đỉnh cao mới về văn hóa, khoa học và chính trị. Cùng lúc đó, nhiều hệ thống tôn giáo và tư tưởng triết học lớn như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Do Thái giáo và triết học Hy Lạp cũng được hình thành tại đây.[72]

Trong nghiên cứu về thời kỳ trung đại (bắt đầu vào khoảng năm 500 CN), giới sử học đề cập đến tầm ảnh hưởng ngày càng sâu rộng của những tôn giáo lớn. Các tôn giáo truyền đạo như Phật giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo lan tỏa nhanh chóng và trở thành tôn giáo thế giới, đánh dấu bước chuyển dịch lớn về văn hóa khi dần thay thế nhiều hệ tín ngưỡng khác. Cùng thời điểm, các mạng lưới thương mại liên khu vực phát triển mạnh mẽ, thúc đẩy sự giao lưu về công nghệ và văn hóa. Vào thế kỷ 13 và 14, đế quốc Mông Cổ xâm lược nhiều vùng lãnh thổ ở châu Á và châu Âu và trở thành thế lực thống trị hàng đầu.[73]

Các sử gia chuyên nghiên cứu thời cận đại (bắt đầu khoảng năm 1500 CN) thường tập trung phân tích quá trình trỗi dậy và thâu tóm quyền lực toàn cầu của các nước châu Âu. Những nước đế quốc thuốc súng này đã tiến hành khai phá và thực dân hóa nhiều khu vực rộng lớn trên thế giới. Hệ quả là châu Mỹ được kết nối vào mạng lưới toàn cầu, khởi đầu cho một cuộc trao đổi sinh học quy mô lớn với sự di chuyển của cả thực vật, động vật, con người và mầm bệnh.[m] Cách mạng khoa học là xúc tác cho các phát kiến lớn và tăng tốc tiến bộ công nghệ, song song với đó là nhiều bước tiến khác về tri thức như chủ nghĩa nhân văn và thời kỳ Khai Sáng, mở đường cho tiến trình thế tục hóa.[75]

Cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp có tác động sâu rộng đến đời sống kinh tế và xã hội, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ xã hội nông nghiệp sang xã hội công nghiệp.[76]
Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử hiện đại (bắt đầu vào cuối thế kỷ 18), giới sử học quan tâm đến cách mà cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp làm chuyển dịch các nền kinh tế nhờ việc cho ra đời những phương thức sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Các cường quốc phương Tây thành lập những đế chế thực dân rộng lớn và củng cố ưu thế nhờ công nghệ quân sự công nghiệp hóa. Sự gia tăng trao đổi hàng hóa, tư tưởng và con người đánh dấu bước đầu của quá trình toàn cầu hóa. Hàng loạt cuộc cách mạng xã hội bùng nổ chống lại các chế độ chuyên quyền và thực dân, đặt nền móng cho những thể chế dân chủ. Nhiều lĩnh vực như khoa học, công nghệ, kinh tế, mức sống và dân số tăng trưởng với tốc độ chưa từng có bất chấp tàn phá nặng nề từ hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới, vốn đã làm thay đổi căn bản cán cân quyền lực quốc tế với sự suy yếu vai trò thống trị của châu Âu.[77]

Theo vị trí địa lý
Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng có thể được phân loại theo vị trí địa lý.[78] Yếu tố địa lý đóng vai trò quan trọng trong lịch sử do có ảnh hưởng đến sản xuất thực phẩm, tài nguyên thiên nhiên, hoạt động kinh tế, ranh giới chính trị và giao lưu văn hóa.[79][n] Một số tác phẩm lịch sử có phạm vi nghiên cứu chỉ ở những khu vực nhỏ như làng xã hay khu định cư, còn số khác tập trung vào các vùng lãnh thổ rộng lớn trải khắp toàn bộ châu lục, ví dụ như lịch sử châu Phi, châu Á, châu Âu, châu Mỹ và châu Đại Dương.[81]

Lịch sử châu Phi khởi đầu với nghiên cứu về sự tiến hóa của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu.[83] Các nhà sử học cổ đại mô tả quá trình phát minh chữ viết và cái nôi của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại vào thiên niên kỷ 4 TCN.[84] Trong thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, nhiều nền văn minh và vương quốc tiêu biểu khác được hình thành tại Nubia, Axum, Carthage, Ghana, Mali và Songhay.[85] Hồi giáo bắt đầu lan truyền khắp Bắc Phi vào thế kỷ 7 CN và trở thành đức tin lớn nhất ở nhiều đế quốc. Trong khi đó, hoạt động thương mại dọc theo tuyến xuyên Sahara phát triển mạnh.[86] Từ thế kỷ 15, hàng triệu người châu Phi bị bắt làm nô lệ và đưa sang châu Mỹ trong khuôn khổ cuộc buôn bán nô lệ Đại Tây Dương.[87] Phần lớn châu lục rơi vào ách đô hộ của các cường quốc châu Âu vào cuối thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20.[88] Trước làn sóng chủ nghĩa dân tộc, các nước châu Phi dần giành lại độc lập trong giai đoạn sau Thế chiến II, một thời kỳ chứng kiến tiến bộ kinh tế, tăng trưởng nhanh về dân số và đấu tranh vì ổn định chính trị.[89]

Giới sử học nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Á nhận thấy người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 100.000 năm trước.[90] Châu Á được xem là một trong những cái nôi của nền văn minh nhân loại với sự ra đời một số nền văn minh cổ đại đầu tiên ở Lưỡng Hà, lưu vực sông Ấn và Trung Quốc bắt đầu từ thiên niên kỷ thứ 4 và thứ 3 TCN.[91] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, các nền văn minh ở châu Á lục địa sản sinh ra tất cả các tôn giáo thế giới lớn và một số truyền thống triết học tiêu biểu như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Đạo giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo.[92] Khoảng thời gian này còn chứng kiến việc con đường tơ lụa được thành lập nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại và trao đổi văn hóa trên khắp lục địa Á-Âu, cùng với đó là sự hình thành các đế chế hùng mạnh như đế quốc Mông Cổ.[93] Ảnh hưởng của châu Âu dần gia tăng trong những thế kỷ tiếp theo, mở ra thời kỳ hiện đại, và đạt đỉnh vào thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20 khi nhiều khu vực của châu Á rơi vào ách cai trị thực dân đến khi Thế chiến II kết thúc.[94] Sau khi giành lại độc lập, các quốc gia châu Á bước vào giai đoạn hiện đại hóa với nền kinh tế và quy mô dân số tăng trưởng nhanh.[95]

Do tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến văn hóa và triết học phương Tây, Hy Lạp cổ đại là một đối tượng nghiên cứu quan trọng đối với các nhà sử học châu Âu.[96]
Trong nghiên cứu lịch sử châu Âu, các sử gia mô tả sự xuất hiện của những người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đầu tiên cách đây khoảng 45.000 năm.[97] Nhiều công trình nghiên cứu tập trung tìm hiểu những đóng góp quan trọng từ Hy Lạp cổ đại cho văn hóa, triết học và chính trị gắn liền với thế giới phương Tây vào thiên niên kỷ thứ nhất TCN,[96] cũng như cảm hứng từ di sản văn hóa của nền văn minh này đối với đế quốc La Mã và Đông La Mã.[98] Thời kỳ trung đại bắt đầu với việc đế quốc Tây La Mã sụp đổ vào thế kỷ 5 CN và được đánh dấu bởi làn sóng lan truyền Kitô giáo.[99] Từ thế kỷ 15, công cuộc khai phá và thuộc địa hóa từ châu Âu đã làm kết nối các châu lục lại với nhau, trong khi những bước tiến văn hóa, tri thức và khoa học thúc đẩy sự thay đổi của nhiều xã hội phương Tây.[100] Từ cuối thế kỷ 18 đến đầu thế kỷ 20, thế thống trị toàn cầu của châu Âu được củng cố bởi cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp và sự thành lập các thuộc địa lớn.[101] Thế thống trị đó chấm dứt do hậu quả thảm khốc của hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới.[102] Đến thời Chiến tranh Lạnh, châu lục bị chia cắt thành một khối phía Tây và một khối phía Đông. Cả hai khối cùng thúc đẩy hợp tác chính trị và kinh tế sâu rộng hơn sau khi Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc.[103]

Giới sử học khảo sát lịch sử châu Mỹ ghi nhận sự hiện diện những con người đầu tiên vào khoảng 20.000 đến 15.000 năm trước.[104] Châu Mỹ là cái nôi của vài trong số các nền văn minh sớm nhất như văn minh Norte Chico ở Nam Mỹ và văn minh Maya và Olmec ở Trung Mỹ.[105] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo chứng kiến sự xuất hiện nhiều đế chế lớn như Teotihuacan, Aztec và đế quốc Inca.[106] Sau khi người châu Âu gia nhập lục địa từ cuối thế kỷ 15, nhiều căn bệnh truyền nhiễm mới lan rộng dẫn đến dân số sụt giảm nghiêm trọng. Việc này cùng với quá trình thực dân hóa đã khiến các đế chế lớn sụp đổ và làm cấu trúc nhân khẩu học cũng như diện mạo văn hóa thay đổi toàn diện.[107] Các phong trào độc lập vào thế kỷ 18 và 19 dẫn đến việc hình thành những quốc gia mới trên khắp châu Mỹ.[108] Đến thế kỷ 20, Mỹ vươn lên trở thành cường quốc toàn cầu và đóng vai trò nổi bật trong cục diện Chiến tranh Lạnh.[109]

Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Đại Dương, các sử gia nhận định con người đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 60.000 đến 50.000 năm trước.[110] Quá trình phát triển các xã hội và nền văn hóa khu vực đa dạng được ghi nhận đầu tiên ở Úc và Papua New Guinea, sau mới đến các đảo khác thuộc Thái Bình Dương.[111] Sự gia nhập của người châu Âu vào thế kỷ 16 mang đến nhiều biến đổi sâu sắc, và đến cuối thế kỷ 19 phần lớn khu vực đã bị các nước phương Tây kiểm soát.[112] Châu Đại Dương đã tham gia nhiều cuộc xung đột trong hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới và trải qua giai đoạn phi thực dân hóa trong thời hậu chiến.[113]

Theo đề tài
Giới sử học thường giới hạn phạm vi khảo cứu về một chủ đề cụ thể.[114] Một số học giả đề xuất phân chia tổng quát thành ba đề tài chính: lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử kinh tế và lịch sử xã hội. Tuy nhiên, ranh giới giữa các phân nhánh này là mơ hồ và quan hệ giữa chúng với các phân nhánh đề tài khác như lịch sử trí thức không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng.[115]

Lịch sử chính trị nghiên cứu tổ chức quyền lực trong xã hội, tìm hiểu cách thức ra đời, phát triển và tác động qua lại của các cấu trúc quyền lực. Nhà nước hoặc các cấu trúc tương tự nhà nước là đối tượng trọng tâm của lĩnh vực nghiên cứu này xuyên suốt phần lớn lịch sử được ghi chép. Lịch sử chính trị phân tích cơ chế tổ chức nội bộ của một quốc gia, ví dụ như bè phái, đảng phái, tầng lớp lãnh đạo và các thể chế chính trị khác. Phân nhánh này còn nghiên cứu về việc hoạch định và thực thi chính sách cũng như quan hệ giữa nhà nước với các quốc gia khác.[116] Lịch sử chính trị là một trong những phân nhánh lâu đời nhất của lịch sử do đã được các sử gia như Herodotos và Thucydides nghiên cứu từ thời cổ đại, trong khi các lĩnh vực con tiêu biểu khác chỉ mới được công nhận là phân nhánh độc lập vào thế kỷ trước.[117]

Ảnh chụp một máy bắn đá thời trung cổ được phục dựng trên một bệ đá với nền trời nhiều mây ở phía sau
Lịch sử quân sự nghiên cứu về xung đột vũ trang, bao gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ quân sự như máy bắn đá.[118]
Lịch sử ngoại giao và lịch sử quân sự có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử chính trị. Lịch sử ngoại giao khảo sát quan hệ quốc tế giữa các quốc gia, bao gồm những vấn đề liên quan đến chính sách đối ngoại như đàm phán, toan tính chiến lược, hiệp ước và xung đột giữa các nước cũng như vai trò của các tổ chức quốc tế trong những quy trình này.[119] Lịch sử quân sự phân tích sự hình thành, phát triển và tác động của các cuộc xung đột vũ trang trong lịch sử thế giới. Phạm vi nghiên cứu của lịch sử quân sự bao gồm phân tích về các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như tìm hiểu một trận chiến hay nguyên nhân gây ra một cuộc chiến tranh. Lịch sử quân sự còn xem xét tổng quan về sự phát triển của chiến tranh, trong đó gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ, chiến lược, chiến thuật, hậu cần và thể chế quân sự.[120]

Lịch sử kinh tế nghiên cứu cách thức sản xuất, trao đổi và tiêu thụ hàng hóa. Lĩnh vực này bao quát những khía cạnh kinh tế như sử dụng đất, lao động và tư bản, cung và cầu hàng hóa, chi phí và tư liệu sản xuất, phân phối thu nhập và của cải. Các nhà sử học kinh tế thường chú trọng phân tích những xu hướng chung mang tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như lạm phát, hơn là hành động và quyết định của cá nhân. Nếu có đủ dữ liệu, họ thường sử dụng các phương pháp định lượng như phân tích thống kê. Ở những giai đoạn trước thời kỳ hiện đại, dữ liệu có sẵn thường bị hạn chế, buộc giới sử học kinh tế phải phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tài liệu khan hiếm và ngoại suy thông tin từ chúng.[121]

Lịch sử xã hội là một lĩnh vực rộng lớn chuyên nghiên cứu những hiện tượng xã hội, song định nghĩa chính xác của nó chưa có sự thống nhất. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem đây là ngành nghiên cứu về cuộc sống thường ngày ngoài phạm vi chính trị và kinh tế, bao gồm tập quán văn hóa, cấu trúc gia đình, quan hệ cộng đồng và giáo dục. Một hướng tiếp cận mật thiết chú trọng nhiều hơn vào khám phá kinh nghiệm từ các nhóm xã hội cụ thể như giai cấp, chủng tộc, giới tính hoặc nhóm tuổi đối với thế giới mình đang sinh sống. Các cách hiểu khác coi lịch sử xã hội là nghiên cứu về những vấn đề xã hội như đói nghèo, bệnh tật và tội phạm, hoặc mở rộng phạm vi để xem xét sự phát triển của toàn thể xã hội nói chung.[122] Một số lĩnh vực có liên hệ gần gũi với lịch sử xã hội bao gồm lịch sử văn hóa, lịch sử giới tính và lịch sử tôn giáo.[123]

Lịch sử trí thức là lịch sử về tư tưởng, chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình phát triển của các khái niệm, triết lý và ý thức hệ. Nhánh này đặc biệt quan tâm đến các lĩnh vực học thuật nhưng mặt khác còn bao gồm nghiên cứu về tín ngưỡng và định kiến trong đời sống của con người bình thường. Bên cạnh việc tìm hiểu các phong trào trí thức, lịch sử trí thức còn khảo sát bối cảnh văn hóa và xã hội đã góp phần định hình nên những phong trào đó cũng như ảnh hưởng từ chúng đối với các tiến trình lịch sử khác.[124] Là hai trong những lĩnh vực liên quan mật thiết, lịch sử triết học phân tích sự phát triển của tư tưởng triết lý[125] còn lịch sử khoa học nghiên cứu quá trình biến đổi của lý thuyết và thực tiễn khoa học, chẳng hạn như những đóng góp khoa học của Charles Darwin và Albert Einstein.[126] Lịch sử học nghệ thuật là một bộ môn khác có liên hệ với lịch sử trí thức, chuyên suy xét các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trong lịch sử cùng với sự phát triển của các hình thức, phong cách và trào lưu nghệ thuật. Lịch sử học nghệ thuật bao gồm bàn luận về bối cảnh văn hóa, xã hội và chính trị của sáng tạo nghệ thuật.[127]

Lịch sử môi trường nghiên cứu quan hệ giữa con người và môi trường sống, hướng đến am hiểu cách mà loài người và phần còn lại của tự nhiên tác động lẫn nhau trong chiều dài lịch sử.[128] Một số phân nhánh khác theo đề tài bao gồm lịch sử hiến pháp, lịch sử luật pháp, lịch sử đô thị, lịch sử kinh doanh, lịch sử công nghệ, lịch sử y học, lịch sử giáo dục và lịch sử dân tộc.[129]

Lĩnh vực khác
Một số phân nhánh của lịch sử được đặc trưng bởi phương pháp mà chúng áp dụng. Chẳng hạn, lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử phụ thuộc lần lượt vào các phương pháp định lượng và phương tiện truyền thông kỹ thuật số trong nghiên cứu.[130] Lịch sử so sánh đối chiếu các hiện tượng lịch sử thuộc những thời kỳ, khu vực hoặc nền văn hóa phân biệt để xem xét những điểm giống và khác nhau giữa chúng.[131] Không giống như hầu hết phân nhánh khác, lịch sử truyền miệng dựa vào lời kể thay vì tài liệu ghi chép, bao hàm tường thuật nhân chứng, chứng cứ nghe nói lại và truyền thuyết cộng đồng. Lịch sử truyền miệng phản ánh kinh nghiệm cá nhân, sự diễn giải và trí nhớ của những người dân thường, cho thấy tính chủ quan trong cách con người ghi nhớ lịch sử.[132] Lịch sử phản thực tế sử dụng tư duy phản thực tế để khảo sát những hướng đi khác của lịch sử và khám phá những gì có thể sẽ xảy ra dưới những điều kiện khác nhau.[133] Một vài phân nhánh nhất định của lịch sử được tách bạch dựa trên quan điểm lý thuyết, ví dụ như lịch sử Mác-xít và lịch sử nữ quyền.[134]

Lịch sử thế giới nghiên cứu lịch sử ở cấp độ toàn cầu, kết hợp với toàn bộ lịch sử loài người.[135]
Một số cách phân chia lĩnh vực tập trung vào tầm vực của đề tài nghiên cứu. Lịch sử Vĩ đại là nhánh có tầm vực rộng nhất, bao hàm mọi thứ từ Vụ Nổ Lớn cho đến hiện tại, kết hợp các yếu tố của vũ trụ học, địa chất học, sinh học và nhân loại học.[9] Lịch sử thế giới là một phân nhánh khác với phạm vi rộng, khảo sát toàn thể lịch sử loài người bắt đầu từ sự tiến hóa của các loài giống người.[135] Các thuật ngữ lịch sử vĩ mô hay lịch sử vi mô chỉ những cấp độ quy mô phân tích khác nhau, dao động từ các quy luật mang tính toàn cầu đến nghiên cứu chi tiết về bối cảnh địa phương, cộng đồng nhỏ, gia đình, cá nhân hoặc sự kiện cụ thể.[136] Có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử vi mô là thể loại tiểu sử lịch sử, chuyên thuật lại cuộc đời của một cá nhân trong bối cảnh thời đại và di sản mà nhân vật để lại.[137]

Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm các hoạt động nhằm trình bày lịch sử đến công chúng. Việc này thường diễn ra bên ngoài phạm vi học thuật truyền thống ở những bối cảnh như bảo tàng, di tích lịch sử, du lịch di sản và truyền thông đại chúng.[138]

Quá trình phát triển của bộ môn
Trước khi có chữ viết, tri thức lịch sử được lưu truyền chủ yếu qua truyền miệng.[139] Những bản ghi chép lịch sử sớm nhất thường đan xen giữa các sự kiện có thật với yếu tố thần thoại, chẳng hạn như Sử thi Gilgamesh từ Lưỡng Hà cổ đại và Odyssey, một tác phẩm của Hy Lạp cổ đại được cho là do Homeros sáng tác.[140] Xuất bản vào thế kỷ 5 TCN, cuốn Lịch sử của Herodotos[o] là một trong những công trình nền tảng của truyền thống sử học phương Tây, trong đó tác giả chú trọng vào khảo cứu dựa trên lý tính và bằng chứng thay vì những câu chuyện của Homeros và các thi sĩ khác.[142] Thucydides kế thừa và phát triển phương pháp của Herodotos nhưng tập trung nhiều hơn vào các tiến trình phát triển chính trị và quân sự cụ thể, trái ngược với phạm vi rộng cùng các yếu tố dân tộc chí trong tác phẩm của Herodotos.[143] Sử luận La Mã chịu ảnh hưởng lớn từ truyền thống Hy Lạp, kết hợp giữa việc ghi chép sự kiện và phán xét đạo đức về các nhân vật lịch sử.[p] Các sử gia La Mã thời kỳ đầu sử dụng phong cách biên niên sử, sắp xếp các sự kiện theo từng năm và hầu như không bình luận gì thêm, còn những tác giả về sau ưu tiên nhiều hơn vào tường thuật và phân tích.[145]

Sử ký của Tư Mã Thiên là một trong những tự sự lịch sử công phu ra đời sớm nhất về lịch sử Trung Quốc và thế giới theo hiểu biết của người Trung Hoa.[146]
Một truyền thống chép sử lớn khác ra đời tại Trung Quốc cổ đại với các tiền thân đầu tiên xuất hiện vào cuối thiên niên kỷ thứ 2 TCN. Truyền thống đó xem biên niên sử là hình thái cao nhất của ghi chép lịch sử và đề cao việc kiểm chứng dựa trên sử liệu. Tập quán này gắn liền với triết lý Nho gia và có liên hệ chặt chẽ với bộ máy chính quyền dưới hình thức triều đại cầm quyền. Các sử gia Trung Hoa đã phát triển một phương pháp chép sử mạch lạc và có hệ thống sớm hơn so với những nơi khác.[147] Công trình của Tư Mã Thiên có ảnh hưởng đặc biệt; phương pháp nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ cùng việc thêm thắt những quan điểm khác với chính thống từ ông đã định hình nên hệ tiêu chuẩn cho sử luận về sau.[148] Ở Ấn Độ cổ đại, tự sự lịch sử có sự gắn bó mật thiết với tôn giáo. Chúng thường kết hợp sự kiện có thật với các yếu tố siêu nhiên, điển hình như trong Mahabharata.[149]

Tại châu Âu thời trung đại, lịch sử chủ yếu được giáo sĩ ghi lại dưới hình thức biên niên sử. Giới sử gia Kitô giáo lấy truyền thống Hy-La và Do Thái làm cảm hứng để tường thuật lại quá khứ như một phần trong kế hoạch thiêng liêng do Chúa định sẵn.[150] Những nhân vật tiêu biểu góp phần làm nên tập quán này gồm sử gia Eusebius và Bêđa cùng nhà thần học Augustinô thành Hippo.[151] Ở thế giới Hồi giáo, chép sử cũng chịu ảnh hưởng tương tự từ tôn giáo, lấy góc nhìn Hồi giáo để diễn giải quá khứ. Sử luận Hồi giáo nhấn mạnh vào chuỗi truyền tin để bảo đảm độ tin cậy của tự sự lịch sử.[152] Al-Tabari là tác giả của một bộ sử ký công phu, kéo dài từ thuở khai thiên lập địa đến thời đại đương thời với ông. Ibn Khaldun phản tư các vấn đề nền tảng của chép sử về mặt triết lý, ví dụ như những quy luật phổ quát chi phối các tiến trình lịch sử cũng như giới hạn của chân lý lịch sử.[153]

Vào thời nhà Đường (618–907 CN) tại Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử ngày càng được thể chế hóa sâu hơn khi một cơ quan chuyên trách được thành lập năm 629 CN. Cơ quan này đã giám sát công tác biên soạn thực lục, những bộ ghi chép chi tiết làm nền tảng cho bộ chính sử quốc gia. Giới sử gia nhà Đường đề cao sự khác biệt giữa bản thân các sự kiện đã xảy ra và cách mà chúng được phản ánh trong các văn bản lịch sử.[154] Chép sử thời nhà Tống (960–1279 CN) diễn ra qua nhiều thể loại như bách khoa thư, tiểu sử và tiểu thuyết lịch sử, đồng thời lịch sử cũng trở thành một môn học chính trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc.[155] Tại Nhật Bản, một truyền thống chép sử riêng bắt đầu hình thành vào thế kỷ 8 CN, chịu ảnh hưởng từ mô hình Trung Hoa. Tương tự như ở Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử tại đây gắn bó mật thiết với hoàng thất nhưng các nhà sử học Nhật Bản ít chú trọng hơn vào đánh giá phê phán sử liệu.[156]

Đến thời Phục Hưng và cận đại (khoảng năm 1500 đến 1800), các truyền thống sử học dần trở nên gắn kết và ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau.[157] Từ thế kỷ 14 ở châu Âu, phong trào Phục Hưng đã đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ quan điểm tôn giáo đặc trưng của thời Trung Cổ sang mối quan tâm mới đối với di sản cổ điển Hy Lạp và La Mã. Các nhà nhân văn Phục Hưng sử dụng phương pháp phê phán sử liệu tinh vi nhằm xem xét lại những tác phẩm sử ký tôn giáo trước đây, qua đó góp phần thúc đẩy quá trình thế tục hóa trong ghi chép lịch sử. Từ thế kỷ 15 đến 17, giới sử học nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào vai trò mô phạm của lịch sử và sử dụng lịch sử như một công cụ để củng cố trật tự xã hội hiện có hoặc phục hồi lý tưởng về quá khứ. Khi máy in ép được phát minh, tài liệu viết trở nên dễ tiếp cận với chi phí phải chăng và việc tiếp nhận tri thức lịch sử dần được mở rộng ra bên ngoài giới giáo sĩ và quý tộc. Cùng lúc đó, tư tưởng hướng kinh nghiệm gắn với cuộc cách mạng khoa học đã làm dấy lên hoài nghi về khả năng đạt tới chân lý lịch sử phổ quát.[158] Trong thời kỳ Khai Sáng vào thế kỷ 18, ghi chép lịch sử chịu tác động mạnh mẽ từ chủ nghĩa duy lý và chủ nghĩa hoài nghi. Thời gian này, các nhà sử học tìm cách khai phá những quy luật và ý nghĩa sâu xa trong tiến trình lịch sử với mục đích thách thức quyền lực và giáo điều truyền thống bằng lý trí và phương pháp thực nghiệm. Ngoài ra, phạm vi của nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng được mở rộng thêm và tập trung ngày càng nhiều vào các đề tài xã hội và kinh tế cũng như so sánh các nền văn hóa khác nhau.[159]

Ở Trung Quốc thời nhà Minh (1368–1644), sự quan tâm của công chúng đối với các ấn phẩm ghi chép lịch sử gia tăng rõ rệt. Bên cạnh những công trình do sử quan biên soạn để tiếp nối thực lục của các triều đại trước, nhiều tác phẩm phi chính thức của các học giả tư nhân cũng phát triển mạnh. Những học giả này thường thể hiện phong cách sáng tạo hơn và đôi khi đưa ra diễn giải và tường thuật khác với chính thống.[160] Tại thế giới Hồi giáo, nhiều tập quán chép sử mới ra đời tại đế quốc Safavid, Mogul và Ottoman.[161] Trong khi đó tại châu Mỹ, các nhà thám hiểm châu Âu bắt đầu ghi lại và lý giải những tường thuật lịch sử của các dân tộc bản địa. Những câu chuyện này vốn được lưu truyền qua hình thức truyền miệng hoặc ký hiệu tượng hình và thường mang đến cách nhìn khác biệt so với quan điểm lịch sử của châu Âu đương thời.[162]

Leopold von Ranke đã cách mạng hóa tiêu chuẩn học thuật lịch sử nhờ cho ra đời quy trình đánh giá sử liệu sơ cấp kỹ lưỡng.[163]
Ghi chép lịch sử có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng chuyên nghiệp hóa và khoa học hóa vào thế kỷ 19. Sau công trình của Leopold von Ranke, một phương pháp phê phán sử liệu có hệ thống được thừa nhận rộng rãi và nhiều cơ sở học thuật chuyên về lịch sử như khoa ngành đại học, hiệp hội chuyên môn và tạp chí được thành lập.[164] Cùng với tinh thần khoa học của thời đại, Auguste Comte phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng và đặt ra mục tiêu khám phá những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử tương tự như với các định luật trong tự nhiên.[165] Dựa trên triết lý của Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx đã đề xuất một quy luật chung như vậy trong lý thuyết về chủ nghĩa duy vật lịch sử, cho rằng lực lượng kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp là nguyên nhân cơ bản dẫn đến thay đổi lịch sử.[166] Một bước phát triển quan trọng khác trong giai đoạn này là sự lan tỏa của các phương pháp sử luận châu Âu, vốn dần trở thành hướng tiếp cận chủ đạo trong nghiên cứu học thuật về quá khứ trên thế giới.[167]

Trong thế kỷ 20, những giả định và phương pháp lịch sử truyền thống dần bị đặt nghi vấn, còn tầm vực của nghiên cứu lịch sử tiếp tục được mở rộng.[168] Trường phái Annales kết hợp tri thức về xã hội học, tâm lý học và kinh tế học để nghiên cứu các tiến trình dài hạn.[169] Các chế độ chuyên chế như Đức Quốc Xã, Liên Xô và Trung Quốc thao túng tự sự lịch sử vì mục đích ý thức hệ.[170] Nhiều sử gia lựa chọn nghiên cứu với góc nhìn độc đáo, tập trung vào kinh nghiệm của các nhóm thiểu số xã hội qua những hướng tiếp cận như lịch sử từ dưới lên, lịch sử vi mô, lịch sử truyền miệng và sử học nữ quyền.[171] Chủ nghĩa hậu thực dân tìm cách phê phán và làm suy yếu sự bá chủ của cách tiếp cận phương Tây, còn chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại bác bỏ luận điểm về sự tồn tại một chân lý lịch sử phổ quát duy nhất.[172] Giới sử học trí thức khảo sát quá trình phát triển của các hệ tư tưởng trong lịch sử.[173] Đến nửa sau của thế kỷ, những nỗ lực mới trong biên soạn lịch sử thế giới với quy mô toàn cầu đã thu hút nhiều sự chú ý, trong khi các thành tựu công nghệ trở thành động lực cho sự phát triển của lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử.[174]

Các lĩnh vực liên quan
Sử luận
Bài chi tiết: Sử luận

Ibn Khaldun là một nhân vật tiêu biểu trong sử luận Hồi giáo.[175]
Sử luận là nghiên cứu về các phương pháp và sự phát triển của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Nhà sử luận suy xét cách thức mà sử gia tiến hành nghiên cứu và viết sử, dẫn đến đây là một siêu lý thuyết dưới dạng lịch sử của lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ sử luận theo nghĩa khác để chỉ tường thuật được ghi chép về quá khứ.[176]

Một chủ đề cốt lõi trong sử luận dưới góc độ siêu lý thuyết tập trung vào chuẩn mực của bằng chứng và luận cứ trong khảo cứu lịch sử. Giới sử luận nghiên cứu và hệ thống hóa cách thức sử gia sử dụng tư liệu để xây dựng nên tự sự về quá khứ, trong đó có việc phân tích những giả thiết lý giải làm cơ sở cho quá trình xây dựng tự sự. Một số vấn đề khác có liên quan bao gồm văn phong và thủ pháp tu từ được trình bày trong các tác phẩm lịch sử.[177]

Qua việc so sánh công trình của các sử gia, giới sử luận có thể xác định trường phái tư tưởng dựa trên phương pháp nghiên cứu, giả định và phong cách chung.[178] Chẳng hạn, nhà sử luận khảo sát đặc trưng của trường phái Annales như việc sử dụng dữ liệu định lượng từ nhiều bộ môn hay mối quan tâm chủ yếu đến các quá trình kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn.[179] Sự so sánh còn mở rộng cho toàn thể thời kỳ từ cổ đại đến hiện đại. Bằng cách này, nhà sử luận có thể vạch ra tiến trình phát triển của lịch sử với tư cách một môn học thuật, từ đó cho thấy các phương pháp, đề tài và mục tiêu nghiên cứu chủ đạo đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.[180]

Triết học lịch sử
Bài chi tiết: Triết học lịch sử
Triết học lịch sử[q] suy xét những nền tảng lý thuyết của lịch sử. Bộ môn này quan tâm cả về bản thân quá khứ như là một chuỗi các sự kiện liên kết lẫn nhau và về lĩnh vực học thuật chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình đó. Những hiểu biết và cách tiếp cận từ một số phân nhánh triết học khác như siêu hình học, tri thức luận, thông diễn học và luân lý học có ảnh hưởng nhất định đến triết học lịch sử.[182]

Khi suy xét quá trình lịch sử, triết gia khám phá những thực thể cơ bản làm nên các hiện tượng lịch sử. Một số cách tiếp cận phụ thuộc chủ yếu vào niềm tin và hành động của cá nhân còn số khác bao hàm cả tập thể và các thực thể chung khác như văn minh, thiết chế, ý thức hệ và lực lượng xã hội.[183] Một chủ đề liên quan quan tâm bản chất của các cơ chế nhân quả liên kết những sự kiện lịch sử với nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng.[184] Một quan điểm cho rằng có những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử để xác định hướng tiếp diễn của sự kiện, tương tự như các định luật trong khoa học tự nhiên. Theo một góc nhìn khác, quan hệ nhân quả giữa các sự kiện lịch sử là duy nhất và được định hình bởi những yếu tố tùy cơ.[185] Trước đây, một số nhà triết học đã đưa ra luận cứ rằng hướng đi tổng quát của chiều dài lịch sử luôn tuân theo những quy luật lớn. Theo một luận điểm, lịch sử có tính tuần hoàn, tức là ở quy mô đủ lớn thì các sự kiện riêng lẻ hoặc xu hướng chung luôn lặp lại theo chu kỳ. Một lý thuyết khác khẳng định lịch sử là một quy trình tuyến tính có mục đích, đang chuyển động tới một mục tiêu xác định trước.[186][r]

Các chủ đề triết học lịch sử và sử luận có điểm tương đồng do chúng cùng quan tâm đến tiêu chuẩn của lý luận lịch sử. Nhà sử luận thường tập trung nhiều vào mô tả các phương pháp và tiến trình phát triển cụ thể trong nghiên cứu lịch sử. Trái lại, nhà triết học lịch sử có thiên hướng khám phá những quy luật tổng quát hơn, bao gồm đặt ra những câu hỏi đánh giá về việc phương pháp và giả thiết nào là đúng đắn.[188] Lý luận lịch sử đôi khi được vận dụng làm phương pháp giải thích hiện tượng trong triết học và các bộ môn khác. Phương pháp này, vốn hay gọi là chủ nghĩa lịch sử, lập luận rằng hiểu biết về một sự vật hay hiện tượng nào đó đòi hỏi phải nắm được bối cảnh lịch sử đặc thù hoặc quá trình tiến hóa của nó. Ví dụ, chủ nghĩa lịch sử về chân lý cho rằng chân lý phụ thuộc vào hoàn cảnh lịch sử, tức là không thể tồn tại chân lý xuyên lịch sử. Chủ nghĩa lịch sử tương phản với các hướng tiếp cận tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết vượt thời gian và phổ quát về chủ thể.[189]

Khách quan lịch sử
Nhiều tranh cãi trong triết học lịch sử xoay quanh khả năng tồn tại một tường thuật khách quan về lịch sử. Nhiều nhà lý thuyết nhận định lý tưởng đó là không thể đạt được và chỉ ra nguyên nhân nằm ở bản chất chủ quan trong cách lý giải sự kiện, khía cạnh tự sự của lịch sử cũng như ảnh hưởng của giá trị và thiên kiến cá nhân trong quan điểm và hành động của các nhân vật lịch sử và nhà sử học. Theo một góc nhìn, một số dữ kiện nhất định có tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như dữ kiện về thời điểm xảy ra hạn hán hoặc quân đội nào bị đánh bại. Song, góc nhìn này không đảm bảo tính khách quan tổng quát do sử gia vẫn phải lý giải và tổng hợp dữ kiện để đi đến một tự sự chung phản ánh các xu hướng và tiến trình phát triển lớn.[190] Vì vậy, một số nhà sử học như G. M. Trevelyan và Keith Jenkins đã khẳng định toàn bộ lịch sử đều có thiên kiến và cho rằng tự sự lịch sử không thể tách rời khỏi những giả định chủ quan và phán xét giá trị.[191]

Một số cách nhìn gắn với chủ nghĩa duy thực, chủ nghĩa kinh nghiệm và chủ nghĩa tái thiết[192] xem lịch sử là sự tìm kiếm chân lý hoặc tri thức, những gì mà chúng xem là có thể phục dựng được qua việc đánh giá nghiêm ngặt và diễn giải cẩn trọng các bằng chứng.[193][s] Nhiều học giả khác phê phán quan điểm đó, nhấn mạnh vào bản chất chủ quan và thiên vị của tri thức lịch sử.[t] Những nhà chủ nghĩa quan điểm cho rằng quan điểm lịch sử vốn dĩ đã có tính chủ quan do đòi hỏi phải chọn lọc sử liệu hay nghiên cứu cụ thể và xác định thông tin nào có thể coi là sự thật lịch sử. Họ lập luận mọi phát biểu chỉ có thể mang tính khách quan trong phạm vi nội tại hoặc khi xét tương đối với một trong nhiều góc nhìn lịch sử cạnh tranh lẫn nhau.[198] Một cách nhìn theo chủ nghĩa hoài nghi hoặc thuyết tương đối cực đoan hơn còn khẳng định không có tri thức lịch sử nào có thể được chứng tỏ là khách quan.[199][u] Sự nhấn mạnh về tính chủ quan đó đã được mở rộng trong các lý thuyết hậu hiện đại, vốn nhận định con người không thể nhận thức quá khứ một cách khách quan bởi ý nghĩa của lịch sử thực chất được kiến tạo qua văn bản do con người sáng tạo ra với ngôn ngữ "cấu thành nên thế giới theo cách mà chúng ta nhận thức nó".[201][v] Đáp lại xu hướng trên, các nhà tân duy thực khẳng định lại vai trò trung tâm của phương pháp luận kinh nghiệm trong phân tích lịch sử. Họ thừa nhận sức ảnh hưởng của đánh giá chủ quan nhưng tin rằng chân lý lịch sử vẫn có khả năng đạt tới được.[203][w]

Lịch sử là một bộ phận trong chương trình học tại trường phổ thông ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204] Giáo dục lịch sử giai đoạn đầu hướng tới khơi dậy sự hứng thú cho học sinh về quá khứ và giúp học sinh làm quen với các khái niệm cơ bản của tư tưởng lịch sử. Bằng việc xây dựng nhận thức lịch sử nền tảng, môn lịch sử hướng đến nuôi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc cá nhân và cộng đồng trên cơ sở hiểu biết về nguồn gốc văn hóa.[205] Môn học thường đi theo hình thức tự sự qua việc trình bày những câu chuyện đơn giản, tập trung vào các nhân vật lịch sử hoặc nguồn gốc của ngày lễ, lễ hội và tập quán địa phương.[206] Giáo dục lịch sử nâng cao ở trường trung học bao hàm phạm vi đề tài rộng hơn, từ lịch sử cổ đại đến hiện đại ở cả cấp độ địa phương và toàn cầu. Giai đoạn giáo dục này còn nhằm giúp học sinh làm quen với các phương pháp nghiên cứu lịch sử, bao gồm năng lực lý giải và đánh giá phê phán luận điểm lịch sử.[207]

Có nhiều phương pháp giảng dạy được giáo viên lịch sử áp dụng, bao gồm thuyết trình về các tiến trình phát triển lịch sử, đặt câu hỏi để tạo sự tương tác và kích thích tư duy phản biện, hoặc tổ chức thảo luận nhóm về các đề tài lịch sử. Học sinh làm việc trực tiếp với sử liệu để học cách phân tích và lý giải bằng chứng ở cả hình thức cá nhân và làm việc nhóm. Các em cũng tham gia ghi chép lịch sử để phát triển kỹ năng liên kết tư duy một cách rõ ràng và thuyết phục. Đánh giá qua kiểm tra viết hoặc vấn đáp được thực hiện nhằm đảm bảo đạt được các mục tiêu của môn học.[208] Phương pháp truyền thống trong giáo dục lịch sử thường là trình bày nhiều dữ kiện như ngày xảy ra sự kiện lớn và tên tuổi của các nhân vật lịch sử mà học sinh phải ghi nhớ. Ngược lại, một số cách tiếp cận hiện đại chú trọng khuyến khích tương tác tích cực và hiểu biết liên ngành sâu hơn về các quy luật tổng quát, tập trung vào cả những gì đã xảy ra, vì sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng đối với hiện tại.[209]

Giáo dục lịch sử ở trường công lập phục vụ nhiều mục đích. Một kỹ năng cốt lõi mà môn này hướng đến là năng lực lịch sử, tức khả năng lĩnh hội, phân tích phê phán và phản ứng trước diễn giải lịch sử. Bằng nhận thức về các tiến trình phát triển lớn trong quá khứ, học sinh có thể làm quen với nhiều bối cảnh của đời sống con người, từ đó hiểu rõ hơn thời đại mà mình đang sống cùng với các nền văn hóa đa dạng. Giáo dục lịch sử còn nhằm bồi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc văn hóa qua việc kết nối học sinh với các di sản, truyền thống và phong tục tập quán, chẳng hạn như giới thiệu về những yếu tố biểu tượng gồm di tích, tượng đài, nhân vật lịch sử và lễ hội.[210] Hiểu biết về quá khứ chung và di sản văn hóa có khả năng đóng góp cho sự hình thành bản sắc dân tộc và giúp học sinh sẵn sàng trở thành công dân tích cực. Khía cạnh chính trị này của giáo dục lịch sử có thể dẫn đến tranh cãi về việc nên đưa những chủ đề nào vào sách giáo khoa phổ thông và thậm chí đã từng gây ra cái gọi là chiến luận về lịch sử đối với chương trình học ở một số khu vực.[211] Yếu tố chính trị có khả năng làm các đề tài nhạy cảm bị diễn giải theo hướng thiên lệch nhằm củng cố hình ảnh di sản quốc gia một cách tích cực hơn so với thực tế.[212][x]

Giáo dục không chính quy qua triển lãm tạo tác lịch sử tại các bảo tàng là một bộ phận của lịch sử đại chúng.[214]
Ngoài giáo dục chính quy trong nhà trường, lịch sử còn được giảng dạy theo hình thức không chính quy ngoài lớp học. Lịch sử đại chúng được thể hiện tại những nơi như bảo tàng và khu tưởng niệm, trong đó thường chọn lọc một số hiện vật để chuyển tải những câu chuyện lịch sử cụ thể.[214] Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm lịch sử phổ biến, vốn có mục tiêu làm cho quá khứ trở nên hấp dẫn và dễ tiếp cận đến đối tượng khán giả rộng rãi và không chuyên trong các phương tiện truyền thông như sách, chương trình truyền hình hay nội dung trực tuyến.[215] Một phương tiện giáo dục lịch sử không chính quy khác là truyền thống truyền miệng với sự lưu truyền những tự sự về quá khứ qua nhiều thế hệ.[216]

Các lĩnh vực khác
Lịch sử sử dụng một phương pháp luận liên ngành dựa trên những phát kiến từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, địa chất học, di truyền học, nhân loại học và ngôn ngữ học.[217][y] Khảo cổ học nghiên cứu những tạo tác lịch sử do con người chế tạo và các hình thức văn hóa vật thể khác. Những phát hiện của giới khảo cổ mang lại hiểu biết quan trọng về các hoạt động của con người và quá trình phát triển văn hóa trong quá khứ.[219] Sự diễn giải bằng chứng khảo cổ đặt ra những thách thức riêng, khác biệt so với việc phân tích nhóm tác phẩm lịch sử thông thường ghi chép bằng chữ viết. Điều này đồng thời cũng mở ra những cơ hội mới từ việc trình bày thông tin chưa được ghi chép, cho phép sử gia tiếp cận quá khứ của những xã hội chưa có chữ viết và các nhóm thiểu số trong xã hội có chữ viết qua sự nghiên cứu di tích văn hóa vật chất. Trước khi khảo cổ học hiện đại xuất hiện vào thế kỷ 19, nghiên cứu đồ cổ là nền tảng ban đầu của bộ môn này và đóng vai trò chủ yếu trong bảo tồn tạo tác lịch sử.[220]

Địa chất học và các môn khoa học Trái Đất khác giúp sử gia hiểu được bối cảnh môi trường và các quá trình vật lý ảnh hưởng đến xã hội trong quá khứ, bao gồm điều kiện khí hậu, cảnh quan và hiện tượng tự nhiên.[221] Di truyền học cung cấp thông tin then chốt về nguồn gốc tiến hóa của loài người, di dân, tổ tiên và biến đổi nhân khẩu học.[222] Nhân loại học tìm hiểu văn hóa và hành vi của con người với các khía cạnh như cơ cấu xã hội, hệ tín ngưỡng và thực hành nghi lễ, mang đến cơ sở tri thức cho việc lý giải sự kiện lịch sử.[223] Ngôn ngữ học lịch sử nghiên cứu sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ theo thời gian, có vai trò cần thiết khi cần diễn giải văn bản cổ đại và đồng thời cũng cung cấp thông tin về quy luật di dân và trao đổi văn hóa.[224] Giới sử học còn sử dụng bằng chứng từ các lĩnh vực khác thuộc khoa học vật lý, khoa học sinh học và khoa học xã hội cùng với nhân văn học.[225]

Do có liên quan đến ý thức hệ và bản sắc dân tộc, lịch sử có quan hệ gần gũi với chính trị và những lý thuyết lịch sử có thể tác động trực tiếp đến quyết định chính trị. Chẳng hạn, việc một nước cố gắng sáp nhập lãnh thổ của nước khác theo chủ nghĩa phục hồi lãnh thổ thường có nguyên nhân nằm ở các lý thuyết lịch sử cho rằng vùng lãnh thổ tranh chấp đó thuộc về nước đầu tiên trong quá khứ.[226] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò trọng tâm ở cái gọi là tôn giáo lịch sử, vốn đặt nền tảng giáo lý của mình trên những sự kiện lịch sử. Ví dụ, Kitô giáo thường được phân loại là tôn giáo lịch sử do tập trung vào các sự kiện xoay quanh Chúa Giê-su.[227] Lịch sử còn có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực khác thông qua nghiên cứu về quá khứ của chính những lĩnh vực đó như lịch sử khoa học, toán học, triết học và nghệ thuật.[228]

Ghi chú
^ Một số nhà lý thuyết xác định thời sơ sử là một giai đoạn riêng biệt sau thời tiền sử, kéo dài từ lúc chữ viết được phát minh đến khi xuất hiện những bản chép sử đầu tiên.[6]
^ Lịch sử Vĩ đại (Big History) do nhà sử học David Christian xây dựng vào cuối thập niên 1980 có phạm vi trải dài đến Vụ Nổ Lớn, bao hàm sự phát triển vũ trụ và quá trình tiến hóa sinh học của sự sống bên cạnh lịch sử thế giới.[9]
^ Các sử gia thời kỳ đầu như Herodotos và Thucydides đã coi tự sự của Homeros cùng những nhà thơ khác là không tưởng và không chính xác.[14]
^ Một cách nhìn có liên quan là chủ nghĩa xét lại lịch sử, vốn nhằm lật lại những quan điểm đã được củng cố về lịch sử. Xét lại lịch sử gồm nhiều dạng, từ đưa ra bằng chứng và phương pháp mới chống lại tư duy hiện tại đến chỉ trích giá trị hoặc tầm quan trọng của các sự kiện hoặc nhân vật lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ chủ nghĩa xét lại theo nghĩa trung lập để chỉ bất kỳ sự bác bỏ hoặc diễn giải lại luận điểm chính thống. Số khác cho rằng thuật ngữ gắn với việc làm bỏ qua bằng chứng xác thực và kết hợp các quan niệm tương đối hoặc hoài nghi một cách cực đoan để biện minh góc nhìn ngụy sử, cố ý làm suy giảm uy tín của tri thức đã được khẳng định về các sự kiện lịch sử thông qua phê phán tri thức luận.[21]
^ Hiểu theo nghĩa hẹp, phương pháp lịch sử đôi khi chỉ bao gồm việc đánh giá hoặc phê phán sử liệu.[29]
^ Định nghĩa chính xác về nguồn sơ cấp và nguồn thứ cấp là vấn đề còn tranh cãi. Việc một nguồn tư liệu cụ thể được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp không phải lúc nào cũng có sự thống nhất. Ví dụ, trong trường hợp một người không xuất hiện trong một cuộc bạo loạn nhưng đưa tin về vụ việc đó ngay sau khi xảy ra, một số nhà sử học xem tin bài đó là nguồn sơ cấp còn số khác xem đó là nguồn thứ cấp.[37]
^ Quan niệm lấy đánh giá sử liệu làm trọng tâm của Leopold von Ranke có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến nghiên cứu lịch sử.[40]
^ Bối cảnh và thời điểm xuất bản tài liệu thường được xét đến để hiểu được nghĩa của các thuật ngữ mà tài liệu đang sử dụng. Chẳng hạn, nếu một tài liệu tiếng Anh dùng từ awful, sử gia phải xác định xem từ này thể hiện nghĩa hiện đại 'tồi tệ' hay nghĩa cũ 'đáng kinh ngạc'.[42]
^ Điều này trở nên đặc biệt khó khăn nếu các sử liệu khác nhau đưa ra thông tin dường như mâu thuẫn nhau.[44]
^ Sự sáng tạo và trí tưởng tượng cần có cho bước này là một trong những lý do khiến một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn nghệ thuật thay vì là một môn khoa học.[45]
^ Chẳng hạn, Martha Washington đốt toàn bộ thư từ giữa bà với chồng George Washington, để lại khoảng trống kéo dài hàng chục năm về mối quan hệ giữa hai người.[52] Sự tồn tại cấm kỵ (ví dụ như cấm kỵ đồng tính luyến ái) là một nguyên nhân khác gây ra khoảng trống, có thể dẫn đến hiện tượng có ít thông tin về chủ đề được ghi lại.[51] Thông lệ xóa tên người đã mất bị xem là kẻ thù khỏi ghi chép công khai được gọi là damnatio memoriae.[53]
^ Có nhiều bất đồng về thời điểm bắt đầu và kết thúc chính xác của mỗi thời kỳ. Các cách phân kỳ khác có thể lấy những khoảng thời gian chồng chéo nhau hoặc khác biệt nhiều so với thông thường.[64]
^ Những căn bệnh mới cùng với sự xâm lược và bóc lột quân sự từ châu Âu đã gây ra mất mát lớn về nhân mạng và dẫn đến sự gián đoạn văn hóa trong các cộng đồng bản địa ở châu Mỹ cũng như một số hậu quả nghiêm trọng khác.[74]
^ Nhấn mạnh mối quan hệ mật thiết giữa địa lý và lịch sử, Jules Michelet viết trong lời nói đầu cuốn Histoire de France năm 1869: "không có cơ sở địa lý, con người, những người làm nên lịch sử, dường như đang quá hạnh phúc".[80]
^ Herodotos thường được xem là "cha đẻ của lịch sử" nhưng cũng bị gọi là "cha đẻ của dối trá" bởi không phải mọi tự sự của ông đều đáng tin.[141]
^ Khía cạnh này cũng có thể thấy ở một mức độ nào đó trong những tác phẩm của các sử gia Hy Lạp như Herodotos và Polybius.[144]
^ Lý thuyết lịch sử là một thuật ngữ có liên hệ mật thiết đôi lúc được dùng làm từ đồng nghĩa.[181]
^ Một số triết gia có luận điểm tương tự như Francis Fukuyama rằng "hồi kết của lịch sử" đã đến dựa trên tuyên bố cho rằng quá trình tiến triển ý thức hệ của loài người đã đạt đến cực hạn.[187]
^ Nhà sử học người Đức Leopold von Ranke là một trong những người đề xướng quan trọng nhất của cách tiếp cận khoa học này vào thế kỷ 19.[194] Sir Geoffrey Elton, Arthur Marwick và E. P. Thompson là ba trong số những học giả thời hiện đại tán thành với góc nhìn trên.[193]
^ Những phê phán này dựa trên một số luận cứ như: việc phục dựng toàn bộ quá khứ là bất khả; khi sự kiện đã trôi qua, không thể kiểm chứng tường thuật so với sự kiện mà chỉ có thể kiểm chứng so với tường thuật khác; ghi chép lịch sử do sử gia nối kết và xây dựng, và quá trình tạo lập tự sự bao gồm lý giải và đọc hiểu có chọn lọc;[195] tự thân bằng chứng cũng là chủ quan một cách tất yếu do nội dung trong bằng chứng được nối kết thông qua người tạo ra nó và sự tồn tại qua các quá trình chọn lọc.[196] Từ góc nhìn này, nhận thức muộn và lý thuyết hóa hiện đại cũng cho phép sử gia kết hợp bằng chứng và đưa ra lý giải vốn chỉ có thể thấy được sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra dưới góc độ thiên lệch, tức là lịch sử dưới hình thức quá khứ đã biết là sản phẩm do con người tạo ra.[197]
^ Trong những người đề xướng quan điểm theo thiên hướng thuyết tương đối có E. H. Carr, tác giả của What Is History? (1961) vốn khảo sát tác động từ bối cảnh lịch sử và xã hội đến cách lựa chọn và phân tích dữ kiện của giới sử học.[200]
^ Một số học giả cho rằng việc nhận diện bản chất chủ quan của tư liệu lịch sử là cơ hội để mở ra các lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và phương pháp mới trong làm việc với chủ thể lịch sử; đồng thời cũng mang lại những hướng tiếp cận mới trong phân tích sử liệu, phê phán tự sự chính thống và cho phép nhà sử học làm việc với nhiều khái niệm khác nhau.[202]
^ Richard J. Evans là một trong số những học giả ủng hộ quan điểm này.[203]
^ Chẳng hạn, một số sách giáo khoa lịch sử cấp trung học phổ thông của Nhật Bản đã bị chỉ trích do cố ý hạ thấp những hoạt động thực dân và tham chiến của nước này.[213]
^ Chúng đôi khi được gộp lại thành một nhóm có tên khoa học phụ trợ của lịch sử.[218]

Lịch sử là nghiên cứu có hệ thống về quá khứ, tập trung chủ yếu vào quá khứ của loài người. Dưới hình thức một môn học, lịch sử phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng để tường thuật lại những gì đã xảy ra và giải thích lý do cũng như cách thức mà sự việc đó xảy ra. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội còn số khác xem đây là bộ phận của nhân văn học hoặc là một bộ môn hỗn hợp. Có nhiều tranh luận tương tự xoay quanh mục đích của lịch sử, chẳng hạn như liệu mục tiêu chính của nó là để khám phá chân lý (hướng lý thuyết) hay là rút ra bài học kinh nghiệm từ quá khứ (hướng thực tiễn). Theo cách hiểu suy rộng, ngoài ý nghĩa lĩnh vực học thuật, thuật ngữ lịch sử còn chỉ cả bản thân quá khứ, những thời điểm trong quá khứ hoặc các văn bản riêng lẻ liên quan đến quá khứ.

Nghiên cứu lịch sử phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tư liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp để tái hiện các sự kiện trong quá khứ và xác nhận diễn giải. Phê phán sử liệu là một phương pháp được sử dụng để đánh giá những nguồn này dựa trên tính xác thực, nội dung và độ tin cậy. Giới sử học thường cố gắng kết hợp quan điểm giữa nhiều nguồn tài liệu để tạo nên mạch tự sự thống nhất. Các trường phái tư tưởng khác nhau như chủ nghĩa thực chứng, trường phái Annales, chủ nghĩa Marx và chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại có cách tiếp cận phương pháp luận khác nhau.

Lịch sử là một bộ môn rộng bao gồm nhiều nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào các giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể (ví dụ như thời kỳ cổ đại), còn số khác hướng đến những khu vực địa lý nhất định (chẳng hạn như lịch sử châu Phi). Theo phạm vi lĩnh vực, lịch sử có thể được phân loại thành lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử quân sự, lịch sử xã hội, lịch sử kinh tế, v.v. Các phân nhánh theo loại tư liệu và phương pháp nghiên cứu bao gồm lịch sử định lượng, lịch sử so sánh và lịch sử truyền miệng.

Lịch sử ra đời dưới hình thức lĩnh vực nghiên cứu ở thời cổ đại thay thế những câu chuyện truyền thuyết, bắt nguồn chủ yếu ở Hy Lạp, Trung Quốc và sau này là thế giới Hồi giáo. Ghi chép lịch sử trải qua nhiều biến đổi theo thời gian và ngày càng có tính chuyên nghiệp cao, nhất là vào thế kỷ 19 với sự xuất hiện một phương pháp luận nghiêm ngặt cùng hàng loạt cơ sở học thuật được thành lập. Lịch sử có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực như sử luận, triết học, giáo dục và chính trị.

Định nghĩa
Theo sử gia Đào Duy Anh (1932), lịch sử (ánh xạ với tiếng Pháp histoire) được định nghĩa là "biên chép những sự biến thiên diên cách trải qua các đời" hoặc "biên chép những việc lớn của quốc gia, xã hội".[1]

Dưới dạng một bộ môn học thuật, lịch sử là ngành nghiên cứu về quá khứ, đặc biệt là quá khứ của loài người.[2] Mục tiêu của lịch sử là khái quát và tái hiện những gì đã xảy ra bằng cách thu thập và phân tích các bằng chứng để tổng hợp thành tường thuật. Những tường thuật này làm sáng tỏ diễn biến vụ việc, nguyên nhân hình thành và bối cảnh lịch sử cụ thể, qua đó giải thích điều kiện bối cảnh và cơ chế nhân quả liên quan đến chúng. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn phân tích ý nghĩa của những sự việc trong quá khứ và khám phá những động cơ đã thúc đẩy hành động của con người.[3]

Theo một định nghĩa khác, lịch sử chỉ bản thân các sự kiện trong quá khứ. Theo cách hiểu này, lịch sử chính là những gì đã xảy ra thay vì là môn học thuật nghiên cứu những điều đã xảy ra. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn có một nghĩa khác là ghi chép về quá khứ dưới hình thức văn bản. Văn bản lịch sử là sản phẩm văn hóa phản ánh quá trình lý giải và tái cấu trúc thường xuyên từ các nhà sử học. Cách tường thuật trong các văn bản lịch sử có thể thay đổi khi nhà sử học tìm thấy bằng chứng mới hoặc lý giải lại sử liệu hiện có. Trái lại, bản thân quá khứ là bất biến và không thể thay đổi.[4] Một số sử gia tập trung vào các khía cạnh lý giải và giải thích để phân biệt lịch sử với biên niên sử, với luận điểm rằng biên niên sử chỉ liệt kê các sự kiện theo trình tự thời gian còn lịch sử hướng đến hiểu biết toàn diện về nguyên nhân, bối cảnh đến hệ quả.[5]

Từ trước đến nay, lịch sử chủ yếu nghiên cứu những gì được con người ghi lại bằng chữ viết. Vì thế, môn này tập trung vào các sự kiện xảy ra sau khi con người phát minh ra chữ viết (gọi là lịch sử ghi chép), còn thời kỳ trước đó, gọi là thời tiền sử,[a] thường do ngành khảo cổ học nghiên cứu.[7] Tuy nhiên, sang thế kỷ 20, các nhà sử học đã mở rộng phạm vi và bắt đầu quan tâm nhiều hơn đến quá khứ của loài người trước thời điểm chữ viết ra đời.[8][b]

Giới sử học tranh luận về việc lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội hay là bộ phận của nhân văn học. Tương tự như với khoa học xã hội, nhà sử học xây dựng giả thuyết, thu thập bằng chứng khách quan và trình bày luận điểm dựa trên bằng chứng đó. Mặt khác, lịch sử cũng liên hệ chặt chẽ với nhân văn học vì phụ thuộc vào các khía cạnh chủ quan gắn liền với sự lý giải, kể chuyện, kinh nghiệm của con người và di sản văn hóa.[10] Một số sử gia ủng hộ phân loại theo chỉ một trong hai cách nêu trên, còn số khác xem lịch sử là một môn hỗn hợp không thuộc về phạm trù cụ thể nào theo hướng loại trừ với phạm trù còn lại.[11] Lịch sử đối lập với ngụy sử, một thuật ngữ chỉ sử luận lệch chuẩn do dùng bằng chứng lịch sử gây tranh cãi, cố tình bỏ qua bằng chứng đã xác thực hoặc sử dụng cách thức khác để bóp méo ghi chép lịch sử. Thường được thúc đẩy bởi một số ý thức hệ nhất định, ngụy sử bắt chước phương pháp lịch sử để truyền bá cách tường thuật thiên lệch, gây hiểu lầm, không dựa trên phân tích nghiêm ngặt và thiếu sự đồng thuận về mặt học thuật.[12]

Mục đích
Đã có nhiều ý kiến được đưa ra về mục đích hoặc giá trị của lịch sử. Một số sử gia cho rằng mục đích chính của lịch sử chỉ đơn giản là tìm ra chân lý về quá khứ. Theo quan điểm này, mưu cầu chân lý công tâm là một mục đích tự thân và không nên bị ảnh hưởng bởi những mục đích bên ngoài như chính trị hay ý thức hệ, vì như vậy có thể xuyên tạc quá khứ và ảnh hưởng xấu đến độ chính xác của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Khi đóng vai trò đi tìm chân lý, lịch sử còn có nhiệm vụ làm sáng tỏ những câu chuyện truyền miệng hay thần thoại đã tồn tại từ lâu nhưng thiếu bằng chứng xác thực.[13][c]

Một góc nhìn khác cho rằng giá trị cốt lõi của lịch sử nằm ở những bài học kinh nghiệm để lại cho nhân loại ngày nay. Ý tưởng ở đây là hiểu rõ quá khứ sẽ giúp con người ra quyết định tốt hơn, chẳng hạn như để tránh lặp lại sai lầm của quá khứ.[15] Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn giúp ta hiểu về bản chất con người. Trong những bối cảnh và thời đại khác nhau, con người sẽ cư xử khác đi, giống như việc người ta du lịch để học hỏi về các nền văn hóa mới vậy.[16] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò là chất keo gắn kết xã hội. Khi nhiều người có chung một quá khứ, họ hình thành một bản sắc tập thể vững chắc, nhờ đó các di sản và giá trị văn hóa được bảo tồn và lưu truyền qua nhiều thế hệ.[17] Đối với một số học giả, bao gồm giới sử gia Whig và học giả Mác-xít E. H. Carr, lịch sử là chìa khóa để am hiểu hiện tại[18] và (theo Carr) định hình tương lai.[19]

Lịch sử đôi lúc cũng được sử dụng làm công cụ chính trị và công cụ tuyên truyền, ví dụ như ca ngợi những truyền thống cũ nhằm giúp giới cầm quyền duy trì hiện trạng hoặc phơi bày những bất công trong quá khứ để thúc đẩy thay đổi.[20] Ở dạng cực đoan, người ta cố ý bỏ qua hoặc xuyên tạc bằng chứng để tạo ra những câu chuyện hoàn toàn sai lệch, dẫn đến ngụy sử hoặc xuyên tạc lịch sử.[12][d] Một số ví dụ tiêu biểu gồm phủ nhận sự tồn tại của nạn diệt chủng Holocaust, diệt chủng Armenia, thảm sát Nam Kinh và Holodomor.[22]

Từ nguyên

Từ lịch sử trong tiếng Việt là cách đọc Hán-Việt của hai chữ 歷史 (lìshǐ).[1]

Từ history trong tiếng Anh bắt nguồn từ chữ Hy Lạp cổ ἵστωρ (histōr) tức 'người có học, thông thái'. Từ này phái sinh từ Hy Lạp cổ ἱστορία (historiā), vốn mang nghĩa rộng gắn với tra vấn nói chung và đưa ra lời chứng. Thuật ngữ sau đó được chuyển tự sang tiếng Latinh cổ điển thành historia. Vào thời Hy Lạp hóa và La Mã, ý nghĩa của thuật ngữ có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào khía cạnh tường thuật và nghệ thuật trình bày thay vì nghiên cứu và lời chứng.[24]

Từ history du nhập vào tiếng Anh trung đại vào thế kỷ 14 thông qua chữ histoire của tiếng Pháp cổ.[25] Lúc bấy giờ, nó có nghĩa là 'câu chuyện, truyện kể', gồm cả tường thuật có thật và hư cấu. Vào thế kỷ 15, nghĩa của từ này thay đổi theo hướng bao hàm nhánh tri thức nghiên cứu quá khứ đi đôi với tự sự về quá khứ.[26] Đến thế kỷ 18 và 19, chữ history dần liên hệ chặt chẽ hơn với tường thuật thực tế và tra vấn dựa trên bằng chứng cùng thời điểm với giai đoạn chuyên nghiệp hóa của nghiên cứu lịch sử, một ý nghĩa hiện còn mang tính chi phối trong cách dùng từ đương đại.[27] Ý nghĩa bao hàm cả truyện kể đơn thuần và tự sự có thật về quá khứ cũng hiện diện trong thuật ngữ lịch sử ở nhiều ngôn ngữ châu Âu khác như histoire (tiếng Pháp), storia (tiếng Ý) và Geschichte (tiếng Đức).[28]

Phương pháp
Bài chi tiết: Phương pháp lịch sử
Phương pháp lịch sử là một tập hợp các kỹ thuật mà giới sử học áp dụng để nghiên cứu và lý giải quá khứ, bao gồm các quy trình thu thập, đánh giá và tổng hợp chứng cứ.[e] Phương pháp lịch sử nhằm đảm bảo tính nghiêm ngặt, chính xác và độ tin cậy học thuật về cách lựa chọn, phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng lịch sử.[30] Nghiên cứu lịch sử thường bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi nghiên cứu để xác định phạm vi đề tài. Một số câu hỏi nghiên cứu tập trung đơn thuần vào mô tả những gì đã xảy ra, trong khi số khác hướng đến giải thích lý do một sự kiện cụ thể xảy ra, bác bỏ giả thuyết đã có hoặc xác nhận một giả thuyết mới.[31]

Sử liệu và phê phán sử liệu
Để giải đáp câu hỏi nghiên cứu, các sử gia sử dụng nhiều loại bằng chứng khác nhau để tái hiện lại quá khứ và củng cố cho kết luận của mình. Bằng chứng lịch sử thường được chia thành nguồn sơ cấp và thứ cấp.[32] Nguồn sơ cấp là những thứ được hình thành ngay trong thời kỳ đó. Có nhiều loại nguồn sơ cấp như tài liệu chính thức, thư từ, nhật ký, lời kể của nhân chứng, ảnh chụp, bản ghi âm hoặc ghi hình. Tư liệu sơ cấp còn bao gồm dấu tích lịch sử được tìm thấy qua khảo cổ học, địa chất học và y khoa, ví dụ như hiện vật và hóa thạch lấy từ các cuộc khai quật. Nguồn sơ cấp cho ta bằng chứng trực tiếp nhất về các sự kiện quá khứ.[33]

Nguồn thứ cấp là tư liệu phân tích hoặc lý giải thông tin của tư liệu khác.[35] Việc một nguồn tài liệu được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp phụ thuộc cả vào bản chất lẫn mục đích sử dụng của tư liệu đó. Chẳng hạn, tài liệu nghiên cứu về chế độ nô lệ được viết bằng cách phân tích các tài liệu lịch sử sẽ là nguồn thứ cấp khi nói về chế độ nô lệ nhưng lại là nguồn sơ cấp về quan điểm của sử gia đó.[36][f] Một trong những tiêu chuẩn phải có của một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử đáng tin cậy là tính nhất quán với các tư liệu đã có. Nếu các nhà sử học tìm thấy những nguồn tài liệu mới, họ có thể sẽ phải sửa đổi hoặc bác bỏ những câu chuyện lịch sử đã và đang được công nhận.[38] Để tìm kiếm và tiếp cận với sử liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp, các sử gia thường tra cứu kho lưu trữ, thư viện và bảo tàng. Kho lưu trữ đóng vai trò chủ chốt qua việc lưu lại và công khai vô số tư liệu nguyên bản đến giới nghiên cứu một cách có hệ thống và dễ tiếp cận. Nhờ những tiến bộ công nghệ, giới sử học đang ngày càng tận dụng nguồn tài nguyên trực tuyến với các cơ sở dữ liệu phong phú cùng những kỹ thuật tìm kiếm và truy cập tài liệu.[39]

Phê phán sử liệu là quá trình phân tích và đánh giá thông tin mà một tư liệu cung cấp.[g] Thông thường, quá trình này bắt đầu bằng phê phán ngoại tại, tức là đánh giá tính xác thực của sử liệu bằng cách đặt ra những câu hỏi như sử liệu này ra đời khi nào, ở đâu, ai là tác giả, mục đích người đó làm ra sử liệu là gì, sử liệu có từng bị chỉnh sửa gì sau thời điểm xuất bản hay không. Ngoài ra, phê phán ngoại tại còn bao gồm phân biệt giữa bản gốc, bản sao và bản làm giả.[41]

Phê phán nội tại là đánh giá nội dung của tư liệu, thường bắt đầu bằng việc làm rõ ý nghĩa những gì tư liệu muốn nói. Việc này bao gồm làm rõ nghĩa những từ ngữ có thể gây nhầm lẫn, hoặc nếu tài liệu viết bằng một ngôn ngữ lạ thì cần phải dịch nó ra.[h] Khi đã hiểu nội dung, bước quan trọng nhất là xác định tính chính xác: thông tin có đáng tin không, có bị bóp méo hay trình bày sai sự thật không, có đầy đủ không, có bỏ sót chi tiết quan trọng nào không. Một cách tiến hành những việc trên là đánh giá khả năng trình bày trung thực sự kiện được nghiên cứu của tác giả về mặt nguyên tắc. Ngoài ra, còn có một số phương pháp tiếp cận khác như đánh giá tầm ảnh hưởng của ý định hay thiên kiến từ tác giả và tham chiếu thông tin với các nguồn đáng tin cậy khác. Nhận biết về thiếu sót của sử liệu giúp các nhà sử học quyết định có nên tin tưởng sử liệu đó hay không, nếu có thì nên tin những khía cạnh gì và nên sử dụng nó như thế nào để xây dựng tường thuật.[43]

Tổng hợp lịch sử và các trường phái tư tưởng
Từ bước lựa chọn, phân tích và phê phán sử liệu, sử gia sẽ xác minh được một lượng lớn các luận điểm độc lập về quá khứ. Ở bước tiếp theo, đôi khi còn gọi là tổng hợp lịch sử, nhà sử học sẽ tìm hiểu cách thức liên kết những bằng chứng riêng lẻ đó thành một bức tranh tổng thể.[i] Việc xây dựng góc nhìn bao quát là cần thiết để có sự hiểu biết toàn diện về đề tài nghiên cứu. Đây là một khía cạnh sáng tạo[j] của ghi chép lịch sử nhằm tái hiện và lý giải những gì đã xảy ra thông qua việc xác định mối liên hệ giữa nhiều sự kiện khác nhau.[46] Nhờ đó, sử gia có thể xác định được những sự kiện nào đã diễn ra, nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng là gì.[47] Tuy không có kỹ thuật duy nhất nào được chấp nhận rộng rãi, giới sử học vẫn áp dụng nhiều công cụ và cách tiếp cận diễn giải trong quá trình trên.[48]

Auguste Comte là người phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng, ủng hộ tiếp cận lịch sử trên cơ sở khoa học.[49]
Một công cụ giúp khái quát và trình bày dễ hiểu các quá trình phát triển phức tạp là phân kỳ lịch sử, tức là chia một khoảng thời gian thành nhiều giai đoạn riêng biệt, mỗi giai đoạn được xác định bởi một chủ đề hoặc quá trình phát triển chủ đạo. Ví dụ, hệ thống ba thời đại thường được sử dụng để phân chia lịch sử loài người thuở đầu thành thời đại đồ đá, thời đại đồ đồng và thời đại đồ sắt dựa trên loại nguyên vật liệu và công nghệ chủ yếu đặc trưng cho từng thời kỳ.[50] Một phương pháp khác là nghiên cứu khoảng trống trong ghi chép lịch sử, tức những sự kiện đã từng xảy ra nhưng không để lại bằng chứng đáng kể nào. Những khoảng trống này có thể xuất hiện khi người đương thời cho rằng thông tin quá hiển nhiên nên không cần ghi lại, hoặc khi thông tin bị cố ý giấu giếm hay tiêu hủy.[51][k] Ngược lại, khi có sẵn các tập dữ liệu lớn thì sử gia có thể sử dụng hướng tiếp cận định lượng. Chẳng hạn, các nhà sử học kinh tế và xã hội thường áp dụng phương pháp phân tích thống kê để nhận diện quy luật và xu hướng trong phạm vi tập thể rộng lớn.[54]

Mỗi trường phái tư tưởng có quan điểm riêng về mặt phương pháp luận trong ghi chép lịch sử.[55] Những nhà sử học theo chủ nghĩa thực chứng xem nghiên cứu lịch sử là một hoạt động mang tính khoa học và cho rằng bằng chứng thực nghiệm đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tìm kiếm chân lý khách quan.[56] Trái lại, các nhà hậu hiện đại phủ nhận tính hợp lệ của những đại tự sự vốn được cho là mang lại một chân lý khách quan duy nhất. Chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại thay vào đó đề cao bản chất chủ quan của lý giải lịch sử và xem đây là nền tảng cho sự đa dạng của các quan điểm lịch sử khác nhau.[57] Những nhà Mác-xít cho rằng mọi sự phát triển lịch sử đều bắt nguồn từ động lực kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp.[58] Trường phái Annales tập trung nghiên cứu các xu hướng kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn, lấy những phương pháp định lượng và tiếp cận liên ngành làm trọng tâm.[59] Sử học nữ quyền nghiên cứu vai trò của giới tính xã hội trong lịch sử, đặc biệt quan tâm đến việc phân tích kinh nghiệm của phụ nữ và phê phán các quan niệm mang tính phụ quyền trong chép sử truyền thống.[60]

Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu
Lịch sử là một lĩnh vực nghiên cứu rộng bao gồm nhiều phân nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào một giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể còn số khác tập trung vào một khu vực địa lý hoặc đề tài nhất định. Một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử thường có thể có sự kết hợp nhiều hướng chuyên môn khác nhau; chẳng hạn, một tác phẩm về lịch sử kinh tế ở Ai Cập cổ đại có sự tổng hợp các góc nhìn về mặt thời gian, không gian và chủ đề. Đối với đề tài phạm vi rộng, lượng sử liệu sơ cấp liên quan thường quá lớn để có thể khảo cứu hết, buộc sử gia phải thu hẹp tầm vực chủ đề nghiên cứu hoặc sử dụng thêm tài liệu thứ cấp để đi đến kết luận tổng quan.[61]

Theo giai đoạn
Phân chia theo trình tự thời gian là một cách tiếp cận thường gặp để sắp xếp tiến trình lịch sử rộng lớn thành nhiều phân đoạn. Việc xác định các thời kỳ thường dựa trên những đặc trưng nổi bật của một giai đoạn nhất định cùng với các sự kiện quan trọng đánh dấu sự khởi đầu hoặc kết thúc những bước phát triển đó. Tùy vào bối cảnh nghiên cứu và mức độ chi tiết mà một thời kỳ có thể kéo dài từ vài thập kỷ đến hàng thế kỷ.[62] Một hướng tiếp cận tiêu biểu là chia lịch sử thế giới thành thời tiền sử, thời kỳ cổ đại, thời kỳ trung đại, thời kỳ cận đại và thời kỳ hiện đại.[63][l] Tuy nhiên, tùy theo khu vực và chủ đề nghiên cứu mà có thể có sự khác biệt về ranh giới thời gian giữa các thời kỳ trên và giới sử học cũng có thể sử dụng cách phân kỳ hoàn toàn khác.[65] Chẳng hạn, lịch sử Trung Quốc thường được phân kỳ theo các triều đại chính,[66] trong khi lịch sử châu Mỹ lại thường được chia theo các giai đoạn tiền Colombo, thực dân và hậu thực dân.[67]

Các nhà sử học sử dụng bằng chứng từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau để nghiên cứu thời tiền sử, bao gồm cả hóa thạch như Lucy.[68]
Nghiên cứu thời tiền sử bao gồm khảo sát quá trình tiến hóa của các loài người cổ cách đây vài triệu năm, dẫn đến sự xuất hiện của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu khoảng 200.000 năm trước.[69] Thời gian sau đó, loài người dần di cư khỏi châu Phi để cư trú ở hầu khắp Trái Đất. Về cuối thời tiền sử, những tiến bộ về công nghệ (nhất là trong chế tác công cụ) đã khiến nhiều cộng đồng người từ bỏ lối sống du mục quen thuộc dựa vào săn bắt và hái lượm và chuyển sang lối sống ít vận động dựa trên những hoạt động nông nghiệp sơ khai.[70] Sự thiếu vắng tài liệu thành văn từ thời kỳ này để lại nhiều thách thức đối với các nhà nghiên cứu và là nền tảng để cho ra đời một phương pháp tiếp cận liên ngành trên cơ sở tổng hợp những dạng bằng chứng khác từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, nhân loại học, cổ sinh vật học và địa chất học.[71]

Giới sử gia nghiên cứu thời cổ đại khảo sát sự hình thành các nền văn minh lớn đầu tiên ở những khu vực như Lưỡng Hà, Ai Cập, lưu vực sông Ấn, Trung Quốc và Peru, bắt đầu từ khoảng năm 3500 TCN tại một số nơi. Những biến đổi phức tạp trong xã hội, kinh tế và chính trị đã tạo điều kiện cho việc phát triển các hệ thống chữ viết đầu tiên. Nhờ những thành tựu mới về nông nghiệp, lượng lương thực thặng dư đã giúp các nền văn minh trên nuôi sống được quy mô dân số ngày càng lớn, kéo theo quá trình đô thị hóa, sự thành lập nhiều mạng lưới thương mại và sự xuất hiện những đế chế khu vực. Ở giai đoạn sau của thời cổ đại, đôi khi còn gọi là thời kỳ cổ điển, các xã hội tại Trung Quốc, Ấn Độ, Ba Tư và Địa Trung Hải tiếp tục mở rộng và đạt đến đỉnh cao mới về văn hóa, khoa học và chính trị. Cùng lúc đó, nhiều hệ thống tôn giáo và tư tưởng triết học lớn như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Do Thái giáo và triết học Hy Lạp cũng được hình thành tại đây.[72]

Trong nghiên cứu về thời kỳ trung đại (bắt đầu vào khoảng năm 500 CN), giới sử học đề cập đến tầm ảnh hưởng ngày càng sâu rộng của những tôn giáo lớn. Các tôn giáo truyền đạo như Phật giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo lan tỏa nhanh chóng và trở thành tôn giáo thế giới, đánh dấu bước chuyển dịch lớn về văn hóa khi dần thay thế nhiều hệ tín ngưỡng khác. Cùng thời điểm, các mạng lưới thương mại liên khu vực phát triển mạnh mẽ, thúc đẩy sự giao lưu về công nghệ và văn hóa. Vào thế kỷ 13 và 14, đế quốc Mông Cổ xâm lược nhiều vùng lãnh thổ ở châu Á và châu Âu và trở thành thế lực thống trị hàng đầu.[73]

Các sử gia chuyên nghiên cứu thời cận đại (bắt đầu khoảng năm 1500 CN) thường tập trung phân tích quá trình trỗi dậy và thâu tóm quyền lực toàn cầu của các nước châu Âu. Những nước đế quốc thuốc súng này đã tiến hành khai phá và thực dân hóa nhiều khu vực rộng lớn trên thế giới. Hệ quả là châu Mỹ được kết nối vào mạng lưới toàn cầu, khởi đầu cho một cuộc trao đổi sinh học quy mô lớn với sự di chuyển của cả thực vật, động vật, con người và mầm bệnh.[m] Cách mạng khoa học là xúc tác cho các phát kiến lớn và tăng tốc tiến bộ công nghệ, song song với đó là nhiều bước tiến khác về tri thức như chủ nghĩa nhân văn và thời kỳ Khai Sáng, mở đường cho tiến trình thế tục hóa.[75]

Cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp có tác động sâu rộng đến đời sống kinh tế và xã hội, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ xã hội nông nghiệp sang xã hội công nghiệp.[76]
Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử hiện đại (bắt đầu vào cuối thế kỷ 18), giới sử học quan tâm đến cách mà cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp làm chuyển dịch các nền kinh tế nhờ việc cho ra đời những phương thức sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Các cường quốc phương Tây thành lập những đế chế thực dân rộng lớn và củng cố ưu thế nhờ công nghệ quân sự công nghiệp hóa. Sự gia tăng trao đổi hàng hóa, tư tưởng và con người đánh dấu bước đầu của quá trình toàn cầu hóa. Hàng loạt cuộc cách mạng xã hội bùng nổ chống lại các chế độ chuyên quyền và thực dân, đặt nền móng cho những thể chế dân chủ. Nhiều lĩnh vực như khoa học, công nghệ, kinh tế, mức sống và dân số tăng trưởng với tốc độ chưa từng có bất chấp tàn phá nặng nề từ hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới, vốn đã làm thay đổi căn bản cán cân quyền lực quốc tế với sự suy yếu vai trò thống trị của châu Âu.[77]

Theo vị trí địa lý
Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng có thể được phân loại theo vị trí địa lý.[78] Yếu tố địa lý đóng vai trò quan trọng trong lịch sử do có ảnh hưởng đến sản xuất thực phẩm, tài nguyên thiên nhiên, hoạt động kinh tế, ranh giới chính trị và giao lưu văn hóa.[79][n] Một số tác phẩm lịch sử có phạm vi nghiên cứu chỉ ở những khu vực nhỏ như làng xã hay khu định cư, còn số khác tập trung vào các vùng lãnh thổ rộng lớn trải khắp toàn bộ châu lục, ví dụ như lịch sử châu Phi, châu Á, châu Âu, châu Mỹ và châu Đại Dương.[81]

Quần thể kim tự tháp Giza đại diện cho di sản lâu đời của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại.[82]
Lịch sử châu Phi khởi đầu với nghiên cứu về sự tiến hóa của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu.[83] Các nhà sử học cổ đại mô tả quá trình phát minh chữ viết và cái nôi của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại vào thiên niên kỷ 4 TCN.[84] Trong thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, nhiều nền văn minh và vương quốc tiêu biểu khác được hình thành tại Nubia, Axum, Carthage, Ghana, Mali và Songhay.[85] Hồi giáo bắt đầu lan truyền khắp Bắc Phi vào thế kỷ 7 CN và trở thành đức tin lớn nhất ở nhiều đế quốc. Trong khi đó, hoạt động thương mại dọc theo tuyến xuyên Sahara phát triển mạnh.[86] Từ thế kỷ 15, hàng triệu người châu Phi bị bắt làm nô lệ và đưa sang châu Mỹ trong khuôn khổ cuộc buôn bán nô lệ Đại Tây Dương.[87] Phần lớn châu lục rơi vào ách đô hộ của các cường quốc châu Âu vào cuối thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20.[88] Trước làn sóng chủ nghĩa dân tộc, các nước châu Phi dần giành lại độc lập trong giai đoạn sau Thế chiến II, một thời kỳ chứng kiến tiến bộ kinh tế, tăng trưởng nhanh về dân số và đấu tranh vì ổn định chính trị.[89]

Giới sử học nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Á nhận thấy người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 100.000 năm trước.[90] Châu Á được xem là một trong những cái nôi của nền văn minh nhân loại với sự ra đời một số nền văn minh cổ đại đầu tiên ở Lưỡng Hà, lưu vực sông Ấn và Trung Quốc bắt đầu từ thiên niên kỷ thứ 4 và thứ 3 TCN.[91] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, các nền văn minh ở châu Á lục địa sản sinh ra tất cả các tôn giáo thế giới lớn và một số truyền thống triết học tiêu biểu như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Đạo giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo.[92] Khoảng thời gian này còn chứng kiến việc con đường tơ lụa được thành lập nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại và trao đổi văn hóa trên khắp lục địa Á-Âu, cùng với đó là sự hình thành các đế chế hùng mạnh như đế quốc Mông Cổ.[93] Ảnh hưởng của châu Âu dần gia tăng trong những thế kỷ tiếp theo, mở ra thời kỳ hiện đại, và đạt đỉnh vào thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20 khi nhiều khu vực của châu Á rơi vào ách cai trị thực dân đến khi Thế chiến II kết thúc.[94] Sau khi giành lại độc lập, các quốc gia châu Á bước vào giai đoạn hiện đại hóa với nền kinh tế và quy mô dân số tăng trưởng nhanh.[95]

Do tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến văn hóa và triết học phương Tây, Hy Lạp cổ đại là một đối tượng nghiên cứu quan trọng đối với các nhà sử học châu Âu.[96]
Trong nghiên cứu lịch sử châu Âu, các sử gia mô tả sự xuất hiện của những người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đầu tiên cách đây khoảng 45.000 năm.[97] Nhiều công trình nghiên cứu tập trung tìm hiểu những đóng góp quan trọng từ Hy Lạp cổ đại cho văn hóa, triết học và chính trị gắn liền với thế giới phương Tây vào thiên niên kỷ thứ nhất TCN,[96] cũng như cảm hứng từ di sản văn hóa của nền văn minh này đối với đế quốc La Mã và Đông La Mã.[98] Thời kỳ trung đại bắt đầu với việc đế quốc Tây La Mã sụp đổ vào thế kỷ 5 CN và được đánh dấu bởi làn sóng lan truyền Kitô giáo.[99] Từ thế kỷ 15, công cuộc khai phá và thuộc địa hóa từ châu Âu đã làm kết nối các châu lục lại với nhau, trong khi những bước tiến văn hóa, tri thức và khoa học thúc đẩy sự thay đổi của nhiều xã hội phương Tây.[100] Từ cuối thế kỷ 18 đến đầu thế kỷ 20, thế thống trị toàn cầu của châu Âu được củng cố bởi cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp và sự thành lập các thuộc địa lớn.[101] Thế thống trị đó chấm dứt do hậu quả thảm khốc của hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới.[102] Đến thời Chiến tranh Lạnh, châu lục bị chia cắt thành một khối phía Tây và một khối phía Đông. Cả hai khối cùng thúc đẩy hợp tác chính trị và kinh tế sâu rộng hơn sau khi Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc.[103]

Giới sử học khảo sát lịch sử châu Mỹ ghi nhận sự hiện diện những con người đầu tiên vào khoảng 20.000 đến 15.000 năm trước.[104] Châu Mỹ là cái nôi của vài trong số các nền văn minh sớm nhất như văn minh Norte Chico ở Nam Mỹ và văn minh Maya và Olmec ở Trung Mỹ.[105] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo chứng kiến sự xuất hiện nhiều đế chế lớn như Teotihuacan, Aztec và đế quốc Inca.[106] Sau khi người châu Âu gia nhập lục địa từ cuối thế kỷ 15, nhiều căn bệnh truyền nhiễm mới lan rộng dẫn đến dân số sụt giảm nghiêm trọng. Việc này cùng với quá trình thực dân hóa đã khiến các đế chế lớn sụp đổ và làm cấu trúc nhân khẩu học cũng như diện mạo văn hóa thay đổi toàn diện.[107] Các phong trào độc lập vào thế kỷ 18 và 19 dẫn đến việc hình thành những quốc gia mới trên khắp châu Mỹ.[108] Đến thế kỷ 20, Mỹ vươn lên trở thành cường quốc toàn cầu và đóng vai trò nổi bật trong cục diện Chiến tranh Lạnh.[109]

Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Đại Dương, các sử gia nhận định con người đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 60.000 đến 50.000 năm trước.[110] Quá trình phát triển các xã hội và nền văn hóa khu vực đa dạng được ghi nhận đầu tiên ở Úc và Papua New Guinea, sau mới đến các đảo khác thuộc Thái Bình Dương.[111] Sự gia nhập của người châu Âu vào thế kỷ 16 mang đến nhiều biến đổi sâu sắc, và đến cuối thế kỷ 19 phần lớn khu vực đã bị các nước phương Tây kiểm soát.[112] Châu Đại Dương đã tham gia nhiều cuộc xung đột trong hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới và trải qua giai đoạn phi thực dân hóa trong thời hậu chiến.[113]

Theo đề tài
Giới sử học thường giới hạn phạm vi khảo cứu về một chủ đề cụ thể.[114] Một số học giả đề xuất phân chia tổng quát thành ba đề tài chính: lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử kinh tế và lịch sử xã hội. Tuy nhiên, ranh giới giữa các phân nhánh này là mơ hồ và quan hệ giữa chúng với các phân nhánh đề tài khác như lịch sử trí thức không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng.[115]

Lịch sử chính trị nghiên cứu tổ chức quyền lực trong xã hội, tìm hiểu cách thức ra đời, phát triển và tác động qua lại của các cấu trúc quyền lực. Nhà nước hoặc các cấu trúc tương tự nhà nước là đối tượng trọng tâm của lĩnh vực nghiên cứu này xuyên suốt phần lớn lịch sử được ghi chép. Lịch sử chính trị phân tích cơ chế tổ chức nội bộ của một quốc gia, ví dụ như bè phái, đảng phái, tầng lớp lãnh đạo và các thể chế chính trị khác. Phân nhánh này còn nghiên cứu về việc hoạch định và thực thi chính sách cũng như quan hệ giữa nhà nước với các quốc gia khác.[116] Lịch sử chính trị là một trong những phân nhánh lâu đời nhất của lịch sử do đã được các sử gia như Herodotos và Thucydides nghiên cứu từ thời cổ đại, trong khi các lĩnh vực con tiêu biểu khác chỉ mới được công nhận là phân nhánh độc lập vào thế kỷ trước.[117]

Lịch sử quân sự nghiên cứu về xung đột vũ trang, bao gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ quân sự như máy bắn đá.[118]
Lịch sử ngoại giao và lịch sử quân sự có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử chính trị. Lịch sử ngoại giao khảo sát quan hệ quốc tế giữa các quốc gia, bao gồm những vấn đề liên quan đến chính sách đối ngoại như đàm phán, toan tính chiến lược, hiệp ước và xung đột giữa các nước cũng như vai trò của các tổ chức quốc tế trong những quy trình này.[119] Lịch sử quân sự phân tích sự hình thành, phát triển và tác động của các cuộc xung đột vũ trang trong lịch sử thế giới. Phạm vi nghiên cứu của lịch sử quân sự bao gồm phân tích về các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như tìm hiểu một trận chiến hay nguyên nhân gây ra một cuộc chiến tranh. Lịch sử quân sự còn xem xét tổng quan về sự phát triển của chiến tranh, trong đó gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ, chiến lược, chiến thuật, hậu cần và thể chế quân sự.[120]

Lịch sử kinh tế nghiên cứu cách thức sản xuất, trao đổi và tiêu thụ hàng hóa. Lĩnh vực này bao quát những khía cạnh kinh tế như sử dụng đất, lao động và tư bản, cung và cầu hàng hóa, chi phí và tư liệu sản xuất, phân phối thu nhập và của cải. Các nhà sử học kinh tế thường chú trọng phân tích những xu hướng chung mang tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như lạm phát, hơn là hành động và quyết định của cá nhân. Nếu có đủ dữ liệu, họ thường sử dụng các phương pháp định lượng như phân tích thống kê. Ở những giai đoạn trước thời kỳ hiện đại, dữ liệu có sẵn thường bị hạn chế, buộc giới sử học kinh tế phải phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tài liệu khan hiếm và ngoại suy thông tin từ chúng.[121]

Lịch sử xã hội là một lĩnh vực rộng lớn chuyên nghiên cứu những hiện tượng xã hội, song định nghĩa chính xác của nó chưa có sự thống nhất. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem đây là ngành nghiên cứu về cuộc sống thường ngày ngoài phạm vi chính trị và kinh tế, bao gồm tập quán văn hóa, cấu trúc gia đình, quan hệ cộng đồng và giáo dục. Một hướng tiếp cận mật thiết chú trọng nhiều hơn vào khám phá kinh nghiệm từ các nhóm xã hội cụ thể như giai cấp, chủng tộc, giới tính hoặc nhóm tuổi đối với thế giới mình đang sinh sống. Các cách hiểu khác coi lịch sử xã hội là nghiên cứu về những vấn đề xã hội như đói nghèo, bệnh tật và tội phạm, hoặc mở rộng phạm vi để xem xét sự phát triển của toàn thể xã hội nói chung.[122] Một số lĩnh vực có liên hệ gần gũi với lịch sử xã hội bao gồm lịch sử văn hóa, lịch sử giới tính và lịch sử tôn giáo.[123]

Lịch sử trí thức là lịch sử về tư tưởng, chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình phát triển của các khái niệm, triết lý và ý thức hệ. Nhánh này đặc biệt quan tâm đến các lĩnh vực học thuật nhưng mặt khác còn bao gồm nghiên cứu về tín ngưỡng và định kiến trong đời sống của con người bình thường. Bên cạnh việc tìm hiểu các phong trào trí thức, lịch sử trí thức còn khảo sát bối cảnh văn hóa và xã hội đã góp phần định hình nên những phong trào đó cũng như ảnh hưởng từ chúng đối với các tiến trình lịch sử khác.[124] Là hai trong những lĩnh vực liên quan mật thiết, lịch sử triết học phân tích sự phát triển của tư tưởng triết lý[125] còn lịch sử khoa học nghiên cứu quá trình biến đổi của lý thuyết và thực tiễn khoa học, chẳng hạn như những đóng góp khoa học của Charles Darwin và Albert Einstein.[126] Lịch sử học nghệ thuật là một bộ môn khác có liên hệ với lịch sử trí thức, chuyên suy xét các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trong lịch sử cùng với sự phát triển của các hình thức, phong cách và trào lưu nghệ thuật. Lịch sử học nghệ thuật bao gồm bàn luận về bối cảnh văn hóa, xã hội và chính trị của sáng tạo nghệ thuật.[127]

Lịch sử môi trường nghiên cứu quan hệ giữa con người và môi trường sống, hướng đến am hiểu cách mà loài người và phần còn lại của tự nhiên tác động lẫn nhau trong chiều dài lịch sử.[128] Một số phân nhánh khác theo đề tài bao gồm lịch sử hiến pháp, lịch sử luật pháp, lịch sử đô thị, lịch sử kinh doanh, lịch sử công nghệ, lịch sử y học, lịch sử giáo dục và lịch sử dân tộc.[129]

Lĩnh vực khác
Một số phân nhánh của lịch sử được đặc trưng bởi phương pháp mà chúng áp dụng. Chẳng hạn, lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử phụ thuộc lần lượt vào các phương pháp định lượng và phương tiện truyền thông kỹ thuật số trong nghiên cứu.[130] Lịch sử so sánh đối chiếu các hiện tượng lịch sử thuộc những thời kỳ, khu vực hoặc nền văn hóa phân biệt để xem xét những điểm giống và khác nhau giữa chúng.[131] Không giống như hầu hết phân nhánh khác, lịch sử truyền miệng dựa vào lời kể thay vì tài liệu ghi chép, bao hàm tường thuật nhân chứng, chứng cứ nghe nói lại và truyền thuyết cộng đồng. Lịch sử truyền miệng phản ánh kinh nghiệm cá nhân, sự diễn giải và trí nhớ của những người dân thường, cho thấy tính chủ quan trong cách con người ghi nhớ lịch sử.[132] Lịch sử phản thực tế sử dụng tư duy phản thực tế để khảo sát những hướng đi khác của lịch sử và khám phá những gì có thể sẽ xảy ra dưới những điều kiện khác nhau.[133] Một vài phân nhánh nhất định của lịch sử được tách bạch dựa trên quan điểm lý thuyết, ví dụ như lịch sử Mác-xít và lịch sử nữ quyền.[134]

Lịch sử thế giới nghiên cứu lịch sử ở cấp độ toàn cầu, kết hợp với toàn bộ lịch sử loài người.[135]
Một số cách phân chia lĩnh vực tập trung vào tầm vực của đề tài nghiên cứu. Lịch sử Vĩ đại là nhánh có tầm vực rộng nhất, bao hàm mọi thứ từ Vụ Nổ Lớn cho đến hiện tại, kết hợp các yếu tố của vũ trụ học, địa chất học, sinh học và nhân loại học.[9] Lịch sử thế giới là một phân nhánh khác với phạm vi rộng, khảo sát toàn thể lịch sử loài người bắt đầu từ sự tiến hóa của các loài giống người.[135] Các thuật ngữ lịch sử vĩ mô hay lịch sử vi mô chỉ những cấp độ quy mô phân tích khác nhau, dao động từ các quy luật mang tính toàn cầu đến nghiên cứu chi tiết về bối cảnh địa phương, cộng đồng nhỏ, gia đình, cá nhân hoặc sự kiện cụ thể.[136] Có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử vi mô là thể loại tiểu sử lịch sử, chuyên thuật lại cuộc đời của một cá nhân trong bối cảnh thời đại và di sản mà nhân vật để lại.[137]

Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm các hoạt động nhằm trình bày lịch sử đến công chúng. Việc này thường diễn ra bên ngoài phạm vi học thuật truyền thống ở những bối cảnh như bảo tàng, di tích lịch sử, du lịch di sản và truyền thông đại chúng.[138]

Quá trình phát triển của bộ môn
Trước khi có chữ viết, tri thức lịch sử được lưu truyền chủ yếu qua truyền miệng.[139] Những bản ghi chép lịch sử sớm nhất thường đan xen giữa các sự kiện có thật với yếu tố thần thoại, chẳng hạn như Sử thi Gilgamesh từ Lưỡng Hà cổ đại và Odyssey, một tác phẩm của Hy Lạp cổ đại được cho là do Homeros sáng tác.[140] Xuất bản vào thế kỷ 5 TCN, cuốn Lịch sử của Herodotos[o] là một trong những công trình nền tảng của truyền thống sử học phương Tây, trong đó tác giả chú trọng vào khảo cứu dựa trên lý tính và bằng chứng thay vì những câu chuyện của Homeros và các thi sĩ khác.[142] Thucydides kế thừa và phát triển phương pháp của Herodotos nhưng tập trung nhiều hơn vào các tiến trình phát triển chính trị và quân sự cụ thể, trái ngược với phạm vi rộng cùng các yếu tố dân tộc chí trong tác phẩm của Herodotos.[143] Sử luận La Mã chịu ảnh hưởng lớn từ truyền thống Hy Lạp, kết hợp giữa việc ghi chép sự kiện và phán xét đạo đức về các nhân vật lịch sử.[p] Các sử gia La Mã thời kỳ đầu sử dụng phong cách biên niên sử, sắp xếp các sự kiện theo từng năm và hầu như không bình luận gì thêm, còn những tác giả về sau ưu tiên nhiều hơn vào tường thuật và phân tích.[145]

Sử ký của Tư Mã Thiên là một trong những tự sự lịch sử công phu ra đời sớm nhất về lịch sử Trung Quốc và thế giới theo hiểu biết của người Trung Hoa.[146]
Một truyền thống chép sử lớn khác ra đời tại Trung Quốc cổ đại với các tiền thân đầu tiên xuất hiện vào cuối thiên niên kỷ thứ 2 TCN. Truyền thống đó xem biên niên sử là hình thái cao nhất của ghi chép lịch sử và đề cao việc kiểm chứng dựa trên sử liệu. Tập quán này gắn liền với triết lý Nho gia và có liên hệ chặt chẽ với bộ máy chính quyền dưới hình thức triều đại cầm quyền. Các sử gia Trung Hoa đã phát triển một phương pháp chép sử mạch lạc và có hệ thống sớm hơn so với những nơi khác.[147] Công trình của Tư Mã Thiên có ảnh hưởng đặc biệt; phương pháp nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ cùng việc thêm thắt những quan điểm khác với chính thống từ ông đã định hình nên hệ tiêu chuẩn cho sử luận về sau.[148] Ở Ấn Độ cổ đại, tự sự lịch sử có sự gắn bó mật thiết với tôn giáo. Chúng thường kết hợp sự kiện có thật với các yếu tố siêu nhiên, điển hình như trong Mahabharata.[149]

Tại châu Âu thời trung đại, lịch sử chủ yếu được giáo sĩ ghi lại dưới hình thức biên niên sử. Giới sử gia Kitô giáo lấy truyền thống Hy-La và Do Thái làm cảm hứng để tường thuật lại quá khứ như một phần trong kế hoạch thiêng liêng do Chúa định sẵn.[150] Những nhân vật tiêu biểu góp phần làm nên tập quán này gồm sử gia Eusebius và Bêđa cùng nhà thần học Augustinô thành Hippo.[151] Ở thế giới Hồi giáo, chép sử cũng chịu ảnh hưởng tương tự từ tôn giáo, lấy góc nhìn Hồi giáo để diễn giải quá khứ. Sử luận Hồi giáo nhấn mạnh vào chuỗi truyền tin để bảo đảm độ tin cậy của tự sự lịch sử.[152] Al-Tabari là tác giả của một bộ sử ký công phu, kéo dài từ thuở khai thiên lập địa đến thời đại đương thời với ông. Ibn Khaldun phản tư các vấn đề nền tảng của chép sử về mặt triết lý, ví dụ như những quy luật phổ quát chi phối các tiến trình lịch sử cũng như giới hạn của chân lý lịch sử.[153]

Vào thời nhà Đường (618–907 CN) tại Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử ngày càng được thể chế hóa sâu hơn khi một cơ quan chuyên trách được thành lập năm 629 CN. Cơ quan này đã giám sát công tác biên soạn thực lục, những bộ ghi chép chi tiết làm nền tảng cho bộ chính sử quốc gia. Giới sử gia nhà Đường đề cao sự khác biệt giữa bản thân các sự kiện đã xảy ra và cách mà chúng được phản ánh trong các văn bản lịch sử.[154] Chép sử thời nhà Tống (960–1279 CN) diễn ra qua nhiều thể loại như bách khoa thư, tiểu sử và tiểu thuyết lịch sử, đồng thời lịch sử cũng trở thành một môn học chính trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc.[155] Tại Nhật Bản, một truyền thống chép sử riêng bắt đầu hình thành vào thế kỷ 8 CN, chịu ảnh hưởng từ mô hình Trung Hoa. Tương tự như ở Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử tại đây gắn bó mật thiết với hoàng thất nhưng các nhà sử học Nhật Bản ít chú trọng hơn vào đánh giá phê phán sử liệu.[156]

Đến thời Phục Hưng và cận đại (khoảng năm 1500 đến 1800), các truyền thống sử học dần trở nên gắn kết và ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau.[157] Từ thế kỷ 14 ở châu Âu, phong trào Phục Hưng đã đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ quan điểm tôn giáo đặc trưng của thời Trung Cổ sang mối quan tâm mới đối với di sản cổ điển Hy Lạp và La Mã. Các nhà nhân văn Phục Hưng sử dụng phương pháp phê phán sử liệu tinh vi nhằm xem xét lại những tác phẩm sử ký tôn giáo trước đây, qua đó góp phần thúc đẩy quá trình thế tục hóa trong ghi chép lịch sử. Từ thế kỷ 15 đến 17, giới sử học nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào vai trò mô phạm của lịch sử và sử dụng lịch sử như một công cụ để củng cố trật tự xã hội hiện có hoặc phục hồi lý tưởng về quá khứ. Khi máy in ép được phát minh, tài liệu viết trở nên dễ tiếp cận với chi phí phải chăng và việc tiếp nhận tri thức lịch sử dần được mở rộng ra bên ngoài giới giáo sĩ và quý tộc. Cùng lúc đó, tư tưởng hướng kinh nghiệm gắn với cuộc cách mạng khoa học đã làm dấy lên hoài nghi về khả năng đạt tới chân lý lịch sử phổ quát.[158] Trong thời kỳ Khai Sáng vào thế kỷ 18, ghi chép lịch sử chịu tác động mạnh mẽ từ chủ nghĩa duy lý và chủ nghĩa hoài nghi. Thời gian này, các nhà sử học tìm cách khai phá những quy luật và ý nghĩa sâu xa trong tiến trình lịch sử với mục đích thách thức quyền lực và giáo điều truyền thống bằng lý trí và phương pháp thực nghiệm. Ngoài ra, phạm vi của nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng được mở rộng thêm và tập trung ngày càng nhiều vào các đề tài xã hội và kinh tế cũng như so sánh các nền văn hóa khác nhau.[159]

Ở Trung Quốc thời nhà Minh (1368–1644), sự quan tâm của công chúng đối với các ấn phẩm ghi chép lịch sử gia tăng rõ rệt. Bên cạnh những công trình do sử quan biên soạn để tiếp nối thực lục của các triều đại trước, nhiều tác phẩm phi chính thức của các học giả tư nhân cũng phát triển mạnh. Những học giả này thường thể hiện phong cách sáng tạo hơn và đôi khi đưa ra diễn giải và tường thuật khác với chính thống.[160] Tại thế giới Hồi giáo, nhiều tập quán chép sử mới ra đời tại đế quốc Safavid, Mogul và Ottoman.[161] Trong khi đó tại châu Mỹ, các nhà thám hiểm châu Âu bắt đầu ghi lại và lý giải những tường thuật lịch sử của các dân tộc bản địa. Những câu chuyện này vốn được lưu truyền qua hình thức truyền miệng hoặc ký hiệu tượng hình và thường mang đến cách nhìn khác biệt so với quan điểm lịch sử của châu Âu đương thời.[162]

Leopold von Ranke đã cách mạng hóa tiêu chuẩn học thuật lịch sử nhờ cho ra đời quy trình đánh giá sử liệu sơ cấp kỹ lưỡng.[163]
Ghi chép lịch sử có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng chuyên nghiệp hóa và khoa học hóa vào thế kỷ 19. Sau công trình của Leopold von Ranke, một phương pháp phê phán sử liệu có hệ thống được thừa nhận rộng rãi và nhiều cơ sở học thuật chuyên về lịch sử như khoa ngành đại học, hiệp hội chuyên môn và tạp chí được thành lập.[164] Cùng với tinh thần khoa học của thời đại, Auguste Comte phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng và đặt ra mục tiêu khám phá những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử tương tự như với các định luật trong tự nhiên.[165] Dựa trên triết lý của Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx đã đề xuất một quy luật chung như vậy trong lý thuyết về chủ nghĩa duy vật lịch sử, cho rằng lực lượng kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp là nguyên nhân cơ bản dẫn đến thay đổi lịch sử.[166] Một bước phát triển quan trọng khác trong giai đoạn này là sự lan tỏa của các phương pháp sử luận châu Âu, vốn dần trở thành hướng tiếp cận chủ đạo trong nghiên cứu học thuật về quá khứ trên thế giới.[167]

Trong thế kỷ 20, những giả định và phương pháp lịch sử truyền thống dần bị đặt nghi vấn, còn tầm vực của nghiên cứu lịch sử tiếp tục được mở rộng.[168] Trường phái Annales kết hợp tri thức về xã hội học, tâm lý học và kinh tế học để nghiên cứu các tiến trình dài hạn.[169] Các chế độ chuyên chế như Đức Quốc Xã, Liên Xô và Trung Quốc thao túng tự sự lịch sử vì mục đích ý thức hệ.[170] Nhiều sử gia lựa chọn nghiên cứu với góc nhìn độc đáo, tập trung vào kinh nghiệm của các nhóm thiểu số xã hội qua những hướng tiếp cận như lịch sử từ dưới lên, lịch sử vi mô, lịch sử truyền miệng và sử học nữ quyền.[171] Chủ nghĩa hậu thực dân tìm cách phê phán và làm suy yếu sự bá chủ của cách tiếp cận phương Tây, còn chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại bác bỏ luận điểm về sự tồn tại một chân lý lịch sử phổ quát duy nhất.[172] Giới sử học trí thức khảo sát quá trình phát triển của các hệ tư tưởng trong lịch sử.[173] Đến nửa sau của thế kỷ, những nỗ lực mới trong biên soạn lịch sử thế giới với quy mô toàn cầu đã thu hút nhiều sự chú ý, trong khi các thành tựu công nghệ trở thành động lực cho sự phát triển của lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử.[174]

Các lĩnh vực liên quan
Sử luận
Bài chi tiết: Sử luận

Ibn Khaldun là một nhân vật tiêu biểu trong sử luận Hồi giáo.[175]
Sử luận là nghiên cứu về các phương pháp và sự phát triển của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Nhà sử luận suy xét cách thức mà sử gia tiến hành nghiên cứu và viết sử, dẫn đến đây là một siêu lý thuyết dưới dạng lịch sử của lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ sử luận theo nghĩa khác để chỉ tường thuật được ghi chép về quá khứ.[176]

Một chủ đề cốt lõi trong sử luận dưới góc độ siêu lý thuyết tập trung vào chuẩn mực của bằng chứng và luận cứ trong khảo cứu lịch sử. Giới sử luận nghiên cứu và hệ thống hóa cách thức sử gia sử dụng tư liệu để xây dựng nên tự sự về quá khứ, trong đó có việc phân tích những giả thiết lý giải làm cơ sở cho quá trình xây dựng tự sự. Một số vấn đề khác có liên quan bao gồm văn phong và thủ pháp tu từ được trình bày trong các tác phẩm lịch sử.[177]

Qua việc so sánh công trình của các sử gia, giới sử luận có thể xác định trường phái tư tưởng dựa trên phương pháp nghiên cứu, giả định và phong cách chung.[178] Chẳng hạn, nhà sử luận khảo sát đặc trưng của trường phái Annales như việc sử dụng dữ liệu định lượng từ nhiều bộ môn hay mối quan tâm chủ yếu đến các quá trình kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn.[179] Sự so sánh còn mở rộng cho toàn thể thời kỳ từ cổ đại đến hiện đại. Bằng cách này, nhà sử luận có thể vạch ra tiến trình phát triển của lịch sử với tư cách một môn học thuật, từ đó cho thấy các phương pháp, đề tài và mục tiêu nghiên cứu chủ đạo đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.[180]

Triết học lịch sử
Bài chi tiết: Triết học lịch sử
Triết học lịch sử[q] suy xét những nền tảng lý thuyết của lịch sử. Bộ môn này quan tâm cả về bản thân quá khứ như là một chuỗi các sự kiện liên kết lẫn nhau và về lĩnh vực học thuật chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình đó. Những hiểu biết và cách tiếp cận từ một số phân nhánh triết học khác như siêu hình học, tri thức luận, thông diễn học và luân lý học có ảnh hưởng nhất định đến triết học lịch sử.[182]

Khi suy xét quá trình lịch sử, triết gia khám phá những thực thể cơ bản làm nên các hiện tượng lịch sử. Một số cách tiếp cận phụ thuộc chủ yếu vào niềm tin và hành động của cá nhân còn số khác bao hàm cả tập thể và các thực thể chung khác như văn minh, thiết chế, ý thức hệ và lực lượng xã hội.[183] Một chủ đề liên quan quan tâm bản chất của các cơ chế nhân quả liên kết những sự kiện lịch sử với nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng.[184] Một quan điểm cho rằng có những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử để xác định hướng tiếp diễn của sự kiện, tương tự như các định luật trong khoa học tự nhiên. Theo một góc nhìn khác, quan hệ nhân quả giữa các sự kiện lịch sử là duy nhất và được định hình bởi những yếu tố tùy cơ.[185] Trước đây, một số nhà triết học đã đưa ra luận cứ rằng hướng đi tổng quát của chiều dài lịch sử luôn tuân theo những quy luật lớn. Theo một luận điểm, lịch sử có tính tuần hoàn, tức là ở quy mô đủ lớn thì các sự kiện riêng lẻ hoặc xu hướng chung luôn lặp lại theo chu kỳ. Một lý thuyết khác khẳng định lịch sử là một quy trình tuyến tính có mục đích, đang chuyển động tới một mục tiêu xác định trước.[186][r]

Các chủ đề triết học lịch sử và sử luận có điểm tương đồng do chúng cùng quan tâm đến tiêu chuẩn của lý luận lịch sử. Nhà sử luận thường tập trung nhiều vào mô tả các phương pháp và tiến trình phát triển cụ thể trong nghiên cứu lịch sử. Trái lại, nhà triết học lịch sử có thiên hướng khám phá những quy luật tổng quát hơn, bao gồm đặt ra những câu hỏi đánh giá về việc phương pháp và giả thiết nào là đúng đắn.[188] Lý luận lịch sử đôi khi được vận dụng làm phương pháp giải thích hiện tượng trong triết học và các bộ môn khác. Phương pháp này, vốn hay gọi là chủ nghĩa lịch sử, lập luận rằng hiểu biết về một sự vật hay hiện tượng nào đó đòi hỏi phải nắm được bối cảnh lịch sử đặc thù hoặc quá trình tiến hóa của nó. Ví dụ, chủ nghĩa lịch sử về chân lý cho rằng chân lý phụ thuộc vào hoàn cảnh lịch sử, tức là không thể tồn tại chân lý xuyên lịch sử. Chủ nghĩa lịch sử tương phản với các hướng tiếp cận tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết vượt thời gian và phổ quát về chủ thể.[189]

Khách quan lịch sử
Nhiều tranh cãi trong triết học lịch sử xoay quanh khả năng tồn tại một tường thuật khách quan về lịch sử. Nhiều nhà lý thuyết nhận định lý tưởng đó là không thể đạt được và chỉ ra nguyên nhân nằm ở bản chất chủ quan trong cách lý giải sự kiện, khía cạnh tự sự của lịch sử cũng như ảnh hưởng của giá trị và thiên kiến cá nhân trong quan điểm và hành động của các nhân vật lịch sử và nhà sử học. Theo một góc nhìn, một số dữ kiện nhất định có tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như dữ kiện về thời điểm xảy ra hạn hán hoặc quân đội nào bị đánh bại. Song, góc nhìn này không đảm bảo tính khách quan tổng quát do sử gia vẫn phải lý giải và tổng hợp dữ kiện để đi đến một tự sự chung phản ánh các xu hướng và tiến trình phát triển lớn.[190] Vì vậy, một số nhà sử học như G. M. Trevelyan và Keith Jenkins đã khẳng định toàn bộ lịch sử đều có thiên kiến và cho rằng tự sự lịch sử không thể tách rời khỏi những giả định chủ quan và phán xét giá trị.[191]

Một số cách nhìn gắn với chủ nghĩa duy thực, chủ nghĩa kinh nghiệm và chủ nghĩa tái thiết[192] xem lịch sử là sự tìm kiếm chân lý hoặc tri thức, những gì mà chúng xem là có thể phục dựng được qua việc đánh giá nghiêm ngặt và diễn giải cẩn trọng các bằng chứng.[193][s] Nhiều học giả khác phê phán quan điểm đó, nhấn mạnh vào bản chất chủ quan và thiên vị của tri thức lịch sử.[t] Những nhà chủ nghĩa quan điểm cho rằng quan điểm lịch sử vốn dĩ đã có tính chủ quan do đòi hỏi phải chọn lọc sử liệu hay nghiên cứu cụ thể và xác định thông tin nào có thể coi là sự thật lịch sử. Họ lập luận mọi phát biểu chỉ có thể mang tính khách quan trong phạm vi nội tại hoặc khi xét tương đối với một trong nhiều góc nhìn lịch sử cạnh tranh lẫn nhau.[198] Một cách nhìn theo chủ nghĩa hoài nghi hoặc thuyết tương đối cực đoan hơn còn khẳng định không có tri thức lịch sử nào có thể được chứng tỏ là khách quan.[199][u] Sự nhấn mạnh về tính chủ quan đó đã được mở rộng trong các lý thuyết hậu hiện đại, vốn nhận định con người không thể nhận thức quá khứ một cách khách quan bởi ý nghĩa của lịch sử thực chất được kiến tạo qua văn bản do con người sáng tạo ra với ngôn ngữ "cấu thành nên thế giới theo cách mà chúng ta nhận thức nó".[201][v] Đáp lại xu hướng trên, các nhà tân duy thực khẳng định lại vai trò trung tâm của phương pháp luận kinh nghiệm trong phân tích lịch sử. Họ thừa nhận sức ảnh hưởng của đánh giá chủ quan nhưng tin rằng chân lý lịch sử vẫn có khả năng đạt tới được.[203][w]

Giáo dục

Lịch sử là môn bắt buộc tại trường học ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204]
Lịch sử là một bộ phận trong chương trình học tại trường phổ thông ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204] Giáo dục lịch sử giai đoạn đầu hướng tới khơi dậy sự hứng thú cho học sinh về quá khứ và giúp học sinh làm quen với các khái niệm cơ bản của tư tưởng lịch sử. Bằng việc xây dựng nhận thức lịch sử nền tảng, môn lịch sử hướng đến nuôi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc cá nhân và cộng đồng trên cơ sở hiểu biết về nguồn gốc văn hóa.[205] Môn học thường đi theo hình thức tự sự qua việc trình bày những câu chuyện đơn giản, tập trung vào các nhân vật lịch sử hoặc nguồn gốc của ngày lễ, lễ hội và tập quán địa phương.[206] Giáo dục lịch sử nâng cao ở trường trung học bao hàm phạm vi đề tài rộng hơn, từ lịch sử cổ đại đến hiện đại ở cả cấp độ địa phương và toàn cầu. Giai đoạn giáo dục này còn nhằm giúp học sinh làm quen với các phương pháp nghiên cứu lịch sử, bao gồm năng lực lý giải và đánh giá phê phán luận điểm lịch sử.[207]

Có nhiều phương pháp giảng dạy được giáo viên lịch sử áp dụng, bao gồm thuyết trình về các tiến trình phát triển lịch sử, đặt câu hỏi để tạo sự tương tác và kích thích tư duy phản biện, hoặc tổ chức thảo luận nhóm về các đề tài lịch sử. Học sinh làm việc trực tiếp với sử liệu để học cách phân tích và lý giải bằng chứng ở cả hình thức cá nhân và làm việc nhóm. Các em cũng tham gia ghi chép lịch sử để phát triển kỹ năng liên kết tư duy một cách rõ ràng và thuyết phục. Đánh giá qua kiểm tra viết hoặc vấn đáp được thực hiện nhằm đảm bảo đạt được các mục tiêu của môn học.[208] Phương pháp truyền thống trong giáo dục lịch sử thường là trình bày nhiều dữ kiện như ngày xảy ra sự kiện lớn và tên tuổi của các nhân vật lịch sử mà học sinh phải ghi nhớ. Ngược lại, một số cách tiếp cận hiện đại chú trọng khuyến khích tương tác tích cực và hiểu biết liên ngành sâu hơn về các quy luật tổng quát, tập trung vào cả những gì đã xảy ra, vì sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng đối với hiện tại.[209]

Giáo dục lịch sử ở trường công lập phục vụ nhiều mục đích. Một kỹ năng cốt lõi mà môn này hướng đến là năng lực lịch sử, tức khả năng lĩnh hội, phân tích phê phán và phản ứng trước diễn giải lịch sử. Bằng nhận thức về các tiến trình phát triển lớn trong quá khứ, học sinh có thể làm quen với nhiều bối cảnh của đời sống con người, từ đó hiểu rõ hơn thời đại mà mình đang sống cùng với các nền văn hóa đa dạng. Giáo dục lịch sử còn nhằm bồi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc văn hóa qua việc kết nối học sinh với các di sản, truyền thống và phong tục tập quán, chẳng hạn như giới thiệu về những yếu tố biểu tượng gồm di tích, tượng đài, nhân vật lịch sử và lễ hội.[210] Hiểu biết về quá khứ chung và di sản văn hóa có khả năng đóng góp cho sự hình thành bản sắc dân tộc và giúp học sinh sẵn sàng trở thành công dân tích cực. Khía cạnh chính trị này của giáo dục lịch sử có thể dẫn đến tranh cãi về việc nên đưa những chủ đề nào vào sách giáo khoa phổ thông và thậm chí đã từng gây ra cái gọi là chiến luận về lịch sử đối với chương trình học ở một số khu vực.[211] Yếu tố chính trị có khả năng làm các đề tài nhạy cảm bị diễn giải theo hướng thiên lệch nhằm củng cố hình ảnh di sản quốc gia một cách tích cực hơn so với thực tế.[212][x]

Giáo dục không chính quy qua triển lãm tạo tác lịch sử tại các bảo tàng là một bộ phận của lịch sử đại chúng.[214]
Ngoài giáo dục chính quy trong nhà trường, lịch sử còn được giảng dạy theo hình thức không chính quy ngoài lớp học. Lịch sử đại chúng được thể hiện tại những nơi như bảo tàng và khu tưởng niệm, trong đó thường chọn lọc một số hiện vật để chuyển tải những câu chuyện lịch sử cụ thể.[214] Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm lịch sử phổ biến, vốn có mục tiêu làm cho quá khứ trở nên hấp dẫn và dễ tiếp cận đến đối tượng khán giả rộng rãi và không chuyên trong các phương tiện truyền thông như sách, chương trình truyền hình hay nội dung trực tuyến.[215] Một phương tiện giáo dục lịch sử không chính quy khác là truyền thống truyền miệng với sự lưu truyền những tự sự về quá khứ qua nhiều thế hệ.[216]

Các lĩnh vực khác
Lịch sử sử dụng một phương pháp luận liên ngành dựa trên những phát kiến từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, địa chất học, di truyền học, nhân loại học và ngôn ngữ học.[217][y] Khảo cổ học nghiên cứu những tạo tác lịch sử do con người chế tạo và các hình thức văn hóa vật thể khác. Những phát hiện của giới khảo cổ mang lại hiểu biết quan trọng về các hoạt động của con người và quá trình phát triển văn hóa trong quá khứ.[219] Sự diễn giải bằng chứng khảo cổ đặt ra những thách thức riêng, khác biệt so với việc phân tích nhóm tác phẩm lịch sử thông thường ghi chép bằng chữ viết. Điều này đồng thời cũng mở ra những cơ hội mới từ việc trình bày thông tin chưa được ghi chép, cho phép sử gia tiếp cận quá khứ của những xã hội chưa có chữ viết và các nhóm thiểu số trong xã hội có chữ viết qua sự nghiên cứu di tích văn hóa vật chất. Trước khi khảo cổ học hiện đại xuất hiện vào thế kỷ 19, nghiên cứu đồ cổ là nền tảng ban đầu của bộ môn này và đóng vai trò chủ yếu trong bảo tồn tạo tác lịch sử.[220]

Địa chất học và các môn khoa học Trái Đất khác giúp sử gia hiểu được bối cảnh môi trường và các quá trình vật lý ảnh hưởng đến xã hội trong quá khứ, bao gồm điều kiện khí hậu, cảnh quan và hiện tượng tự nhiên.[221] Di truyền học cung cấp thông tin then chốt về nguồn gốc tiến hóa của loài người, di dân, tổ tiên và biến đổi nhân khẩu học.[222] Nhân loại học tìm hiểu văn hóa và hành vi của con người với các khía cạnh như cơ cấu xã hội, hệ tín ngưỡng và thực hành nghi lễ, mang đến cơ sở tri thức cho việc lý giải sự kiện lịch sử.[223] Ngôn ngữ học lịch sử nghiên cứu sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ theo thời gian, có vai trò cần thiết khi cần diễn giải văn bản cổ đại và đồng thời cũng cung cấp thông tin về quy luật di dân và trao đổi văn hóa.[224] Giới sử học còn sử dụng bằng chứng từ các lĩnh vực khác thuộc khoa học vật lý, khoa học sinh học và khoa học xã hội cùng với nhân văn học.[225]

Do có liên quan đến ý thức hệ và bản sắc dân tộc, lịch sử có quan hệ gần gũi với chính trị và những lý thuyết lịch sử có thể tác động trực tiếp đến quyết định chính trị. Chẳng hạn, việc một nước cố gắng sáp nhập lãnh thổ của nước khác theo chủ nghĩa phục hồi lãnh thổ thường có nguyên nhân nằm ở các lý thuyết lịch sử cho rằng vùng lãnh thổ tranh chấp đó thuộc về nước đầu tiên trong quá khứ.[226] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò trọng tâm ở cái gọi là tôn giáo lịch sử, vốn đặt nền tảng giáo lý của mình trên những sự kiện lịch sử. Ví dụ, Kitô giáo thường được phân loại là tôn giáo lịch sử do tập trung vào các sự kiện xoay quanh Chúa Giê-su.[227] Lịch sử còn có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực khác thông qua nghiên cứu về quá khứ của chính những lĩnh vực đó như lịch sử khoa học, toán học, triết học và nghệ thuật.[228]

Ghi chú
^ Một số nhà lý thuyết xác định thời sơ sử là một giai đoạn riêng biệt sau thời tiền sử, kéo dài từ lúc chữ viết được phát minh đến khi xuất hiện những bản chép sử đầu tiên.[6]
^ Lịch sử Vĩ đại (Big History) do nhà sử học David Christian xây dựng vào cuối thập niên 1980 có phạm vi trải dài đến Vụ Nổ Lớn, bao hàm sự phát triển vũ trụ và quá trình tiến hóa sinh học của sự sống bên cạnh lịch sử thế giới.[9]
^ Các sử gia thời kỳ đầu như Herodotos và Thucydides đã coi tự sự của Homeros cùng những nhà thơ khác là không tưởng và không chính xác.[14]
^ Một cách nhìn có liên quan là chủ nghĩa xét lại lịch sử, vốn nhằm lật lại những quan điểm đã được củng cố về lịch sử. Xét lại lịch sử gồm nhiều dạng, từ đưa ra bằng chứng và phương pháp mới chống lại tư duy hiện tại đến chỉ trích giá trị hoặc tầm quan trọng của các sự kiện hoặc nhân vật lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ chủ nghĩa xét lại theo nghĩa trung lập để chỉ bất kỳ sự bác bỏ hoặc diễn giải lại luận điểm chính thống. Số khác cho rằng thuật ngữ gắn với việc làm bỏ qua bằng chứng xác thực và kết hợp các quan niệm tương đối hoặc hoài nghi một cách cực đoan để biện minh góc nhìn ngụy sử, cố ý làm suy giảm uy tín của tri thức đã được khẳng định về các sự kiện lịch sử thông qua phê phán tri thức luận.[21]
^ Hiểu theo nghĩa hẹp, phương pháp lịch sử đôi khi chỉ bao gồm việc đánh giá hoặc phê phán sử liệu.[29]
^ Định nghĩa chính xác về nguồn sơ cấp và nguồn thứ cấp là vấn đề còn tranh cãi. Việc một nguồn tư liệu cụ thể được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp không phải lúc nào cũng có sự thống nhất. Ví dụ, trong trường hợp một người không xuất hiện trong một cuộc bạo loạn nhưng đưa tin về vụ việc đó ngay sau khi xảy ra, một số nhà sử học xem tin bài đó là nguồn sơ cấp còn số khác xem đó là nguồn thứ cấp.[37]
^ Quan niệm lấy đánh giá sử liệu làm trọng tâm của Leopold von Ranke có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến nghiên cứu lịch sử.[40]
^ Bối cảnh và thời điểm xuất bản tài liệu thường được xét đến để hiểu được nghĩa của các thuật ngữ mà tài liệu đang sử dụng. Chẳng hạn, nếu một tài liệu tiếng Anh dùng từ awful, sử gia phải xác định xem từ này thể hiện nghĩa hiện đại 'tồi tệ' hay nghĩa cũ 'đáng kinh ngạc'.[42]
^ Điều này trở nên đặc biệt khó khăn nếu các sử liệu khác nhau đưa ra thông tin dường như mâu thuẫn nhau.[44]
^ Sự sáng tạo và trí tưởng tượng cần có cho bước này là một trong những lý do khiến một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn nghệ thuật thay vì là một môn khoa học.[45]
^ Chẳng hạn, Martha Washington đốt toàn bộ thư từ giữa bà với chồng George Washington, để lại khoảng trống kéo dài hàng chục năm về mối quan hệ giữa hai người.[52] Sự tồn tại cấm kỵ (ví dụ như cấm kỵ đồng tính luyến ái) là một nguyên nhân khác gây ra khoảng trống, có thể dẫn đến hiện tượng có ít thông tin về chủ đề được ghi lại.[51] Thông lệ xóa tên người đã mất bị xem là kẻ thù khỏi ghi chép công khai được gọi là damnatio memoriae.[53]
^ Có nhiều bất đồng về thời điểm bắt đầu và kết thúc chính xác của mỗi thời kỳ. Các cách phân kỳ khác có thể lấy những khoảng thời gian chồng chéo nhau hoặc khác biệt nhiều so với thông thường.[64]
^ Những căn bệnh mới cùng với sự xâm lược và bóc lột quân sự từ châu Âu đã gây ra mất mát lớn về nhân mạng và dẫn đến sự gián đoạn văn hóa trong các cộng đồng bản địa ở châu Mỹ cũng như một số hậu quả nghiêm trọng khác.[74]
^ Nhấn mạnh mối quan hệ mật thiết giữa địa lý và lịch sử, Jules Michelet viết trong lời nói đầu cuốn Histoire de France năm 1869: "không có cơ sở địa lý, con người, những người làm nên lịch sử, dường như đang quá hạnh phúc".[80]
^ Herodotos thường được xem là "cha đẻ của lịch sử" nhưng cũng bị gọi là "cha đẻ của dối trá" bởi không phải mọi tự sự của ông đều đáng tin.[141]
^ Khía cạnh này cũng có thể thấy ở một mức độ nào đó trong những tác phẩm của các sử gia Hy Lạp như Herodotos và Polybius.[144]
^ Lý thuyết lịch sử là một thuật ngữ có liên hệ mật thiết đôi lúc được dùng làm từ đồng nghĩa.[181]
^ Một số triết gia có luận điểm tương tự như Francis Fukuyama rằng "hồi kết của lịch sử" đã đến dựa trên tuyên bố cho rằng quá trình tiến triển ý thức hệ của loài người đã đạt đến cực hạn.[187]
^ Nhà sử học người Đức Leopold von Ranke là một trong những người đề xướng quan trọng nhất của cách tiếp cận khoa học này vào thế kỷ 19.[194] Sir Geoffrey Elton, Arthur Marwick và E. P. Thompson là ba trong số những học giả thời hiện đại tán thành với góc nhìn trên.[193]
^ Những phê phán này dựa trên một số luận cứ như: việc phục dựng toàn bộ quá khứ là bất khả; khi sự kiện đã trôi qua, không thể kiểm chứng tường thuật so với sự kiện mà chỉ có thể kiểm chứng so với tường thuật khác; ghi chép lịch sử do sử gia nối kết và xây dựng, và quá trình tạo lập tự sự bao gồm lý giải và đọc hiểu có chọn lọc;[195] tự thân bằng chứng cũng là chủ quan một cách tất yếu do nội dung trong bằng chứng được nối kết thông qua người tạo ra nó và sự tồn tại qua các quá trình chọn lọc.[196] Từ góc nhìn này, nhận thức muộn và lý thuyết hóa hiện đại cũng cho phép sử gia kết hợp bằng chứng và đưa ra lý giải vốn chỉ có thể thấy được sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra dưới góc độ thiên lệch, tức là lịch sử dưới hình thức quá khứ đã biết là sản phẩm do con người tạo ra.[197]
^ Trong những người đề xướng quan điểm theo thiên hướng thuyết tương đối có E. H. Carr, tác giả của What Is History? (1961) vốn khảo sát tác động từ bối cảnh lịch sử và xã hội đến cách lựa chọn và phân tích dữ kiện của giới sử học.[200]
^ Một số học giả cho rằng việc nhận diện bản chất chủ quan của tư liệu lịch sử là cơ hội để mở ra các lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và phương pháp mới trong làm việc với chủ thể lịch sử; đồng thời cũng mang lại những hướng tiếp cận mới trong phân tích sử liệu, phê phán tự sự chính thống và cho phép nhà sử học làm việc với nhiều khái niệm khác nhau.[202]
^ Richard J. Evans là một trong số những học giả ủng hộ quan điểm này.[203]
^ Chẳng hạn, một số sách giáo khoa lịch sử cấp trung học phổ thông của Nhật Bản đã bị chỉ trích do cố ý hạ thấp những hoạt động thực dân và tham chiến của nước này.[213]
^ Chúng đôi khi được gộp lại thành một nhóm có tên khoa học phụ trợ của lịch sử.[218]

Lịch sử là nghiên cứu có hệ thống về quá khứ, tập trung chủ yếu vào quá khứ của loài người. Dưới hình thức một môn học, lịch sử phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng để tường thuật lại những gì đã xảy ra và giải thích lý do cũng như cách thức mà sự việc đó xảy ra. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội còn số khác xem đây là bộ phận của nhân văn học hoặc là một bộ môn hỗn hợp. Có nhiều tranh luận tương tự xoay quanh mục đích của lịch sử, chẳng hạn như liệu mục tiêu chính của nó là để khám phá chân lý (hướng lý thuyết) hay là rút ra bài học kinh nghiệm từ quá khứ (hướng thực tiễn). Theo cách hiểu suy rộng, ngoài ý nghĩa lĩnh vực học thuật, thuật ngữ lịch sử còn chỉ cả bản thân quá khứ, những thời điểm trong quá khứ hoặc các văn bản riêng lẻ liên quan đến quá khứ.

Nghiên cứu lịch sử phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tư liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp để tái hiện các sự kiện trong quá khứ và xác nhận diễn giải. Phê phán sử liệu là một phương pháp được sử dụng để đánh giá những nguồn này dựa trên tính xác thực, nội dung và độ tin cậy. Giới sử học thường cố gắng kết hợp quan điểm giữa nhiều nguồn tài liệu để tạo nên mạch tự sự thống nhất. Các trường phái tư tưởng khác nhau như chủ nghĩa thực chứng, trường phái Annales, chủ nghĩa Marx và chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại có cách tiếp cận phương pháp luận khác nhau.

Lịch sử là một bộ môn rộng bao gồm nhiều nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào các giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể (ví dụ như thời kỳ cổ đại), còn số khác hướng đến những khu vực địa lý nhất định (chẳng hạn như lịch sử châu Phi). Theo phạm vi lĩnh vực, lịch sử có thể được phân loại thành lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử quân sự, lịch sử xã hội, lịch sử kinh tế, v.v. Các phân nhánh theo loại tư liệu và phương pháp nghiên cứu bao gồm lịch sử định lượng, lịch sử so sánh và lịch sử truyền miệng.

Lịch sử ra đời dưới hình thức lĩnh vực nghiên cứu ở thời cổ đại thay thế những câu chuyện truyền thuyết, bắt nguồn chủ yếu ở Hy Lạp, Trung Quốc và sau này là thế giới Hồi giáo. Ghi chép lịch sử trải qua nhiều biến đổi theo thời gian và ngày càng có tính chuyên nghiệp cao, nhất là vào thế kỷ 19 với sự xuất hiện một phương pháp luận nghiêm ngặt cùng hàng loạt cơ sở học thuật được thành lập. Lịch sử có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực như sử luận, triết học, giáo dục và chính trị.

Theo sử gia Đào Duy Anh (1932), lịch sử (ánh xạ với tiếng Pháp histoire) được định nghĩa là "biên chép những sự biến thiên diên cách trải qua các đời" hoặc "biên chép những việc lớn của quốc gia, xã hội".[1]

Dưới dạng một bộ môn học thuật, lịch sử là ngành nghiên cứu về quá khứ, đặc biệt là quá khứ của loài người.[2] Mục tiêu của lịch sử là khái quát và tái hiện những gì đã xảy ra bằng cách thu thập và phân tích các bằng chứng để tổng hợp thành tường thuật. Những tường thuật này làm sáng tỏ diễn biến vụ việc, nguyên nhân hình thành và bối cảnh lịch sử cụ thể, qua đó giải thích điều kiện bối cảnh và cơ chế nhân quả liên quan đến chúng. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn phân tích ý nghĩa của những sự việc trong quá khứ và khám phá những động cơ đã thúc đẩy hành động của con người.[3]

Theo một định nghĩa khác, lịch sử chỉ bản thân các sự kiện trong quá khứ. Theo cách hiểu này, lịch sử chính là những gì đã xảy ra thay vì là môn học thuật nghiên cứu những điều đã xảy ra. Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn có một nghĩa khác là ghi chép về quá khứ dưới hình thức văn bản. Văn bản lịch sử là sản phẩm văn hóa phản ánh quá trình lý giải và tái cấu trúc thường xuyên từ các nhà sử học. Cách tường thuật trong các văn bản lịch sử có thể thay đổi khi nhà sử học tìm thấy bằng chứng mới hoặc lý giải lại sử liệu hiện có. Trái lại, bản thân quá khứ là bất biến và không thể thay đổi.[4] Một số sử gia tập trung vào các khía cạnh lý giải và giải thích để phân biệt lịch sử với biên niên sử, với luận điểm rằng biên niên sử chỉ liệt kê các sự kiện theo trình tự thời gian còn lịch sử hướng đến hiểu biết toàn diện về nguyên nhân, bối cảnh đến hệ quả.[5]

Từ trước đến nay, lịch sử chủ yếu nghiên cứu những gì được con người ghi lại bằng chữ viết. Vì thế, môn này tập trung vào các sự kiện xảy ra sau khi con người phát minh ra chữ viết (gọi là lịch sử ghi chép), còn thời kỳ trước đó, gọi là thời tiền sử,[a] thường do ngành khảo cổ học nghiên cứu.[7] Tuy nhiên, sang thế kỷ 20, các nhà sử học đã mở rộng phạm vi và bắt đầu quan tâm nhiều hơn đến quá khứ của loài người trước thời điểm chữ viết ra đời.[8][b]

Giới sử học tranh luận về việc lịch sử là một môn khoa học xã hội hay là bộ phận của nhân văn học. Tương tự như với khoa học xã hội, nhà sử học xây dựng giả thuyết, thu thập bằng chứng khách quan và trình bày luận điểm dựa trên bằng chứng đó. Mặt khác, lịch sử cũng liên hệ chặt chẽ với nhân văn học vì phụ thuộc vào các khía cạnh chủ quan gắn liền với sự lý giải, kể chuyện, kinh nghiệm của con người và di sản văn hóa.[10] Một số sử gia ủng hộ phân loại theo chỉ một trong hai cách nêu trên, còn số khác xem lịch sử là một môn hỗn hợp không thuộc về phạm trù cụ thể nào theo hướng loại trừ với phạm trù còn lại.[11] Lịch sử đối lập với ngụy sử, một thuật ngữ chỉ sử luận lệch chuẩn do dùng bằng chứng lịch sử gây tranh cãi, cố tình bỏ qua bằng chứng đã xác thực hoặc sử dụng cách thức khác để bóp méo ghi chép lịch sử. Thường được thúc đẩy bởi một số ý thức hệ nhất định, ngụy sử bắt chước phương pháp lịch sử để truyền bá cách tường thuật thiên lệch, gây hiểu lầm, không dựa trên phân tích nghiêm ngặt và thiếu sự đồng thuận về mặt học thuật.[12]

Mục đích
Đã có nhiều ý kiến được đưa ra về mục đích hoặc giá trị của lịch sử. Một số sử gia cho rằng mục đích chính của lịch sử chỉ đơn giản là tìm ra chân lý về quá khứ. Theo quan điểm này, mưu cầu chân lý công tâm là một mục đích tự thân và không nên bị ảnh hưởng bởi những mục đích bên ngoài như chính trị hay ý thức hệ, vì như vậy có thể xuyên tạc quá khứ và ảnh hưởng xấu đến độ chính xác của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Khi đóng vai trò đi tìm chân lý, lịch sử còn có nhiệm vụ làm sáng tỏ những câu chuyện truyền miệng hay thần thoại đã tồn tại từ lâu nhưng thiếu bằng chứng xác thực.[13][c]

Một góc nhìn khác cho rằng giá trị cốt lõi của lịch sử nằm ở những bài học kinh nghiệm để lại cho nhân loại ngày nay. Ý tưởng ở đây là hiểu rõ quá khứ sẽ giúp con người ra quyết định tốt hơn, chẳng hạn như để tránh lặp lại sai lầm của quá khứ.[15] Ngoài ra, lịch sử còn giúp ta hiểu về bản chất con người. Trong những bối cảnh và thời đại khác nhau, con người sẽ cư xử khác đi, giống như việc người ta du lịch để học hỏi về các nền văn hóa mới vậy.[16] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò là chất keo gắn kết xã hội. Khi nhiều người có chung một quá khứ, họ hình thành một bản sắc tập thể vững chắc, nhờ đó các di sản và giá trị văn hóa được bảo tồn và lưu truyền qua nhiều thế hệ.[17] Đối với một số học giả, bao gồm giới sử gia Whig và học giả Mác-xít E. H. Carr, lịch sử là chìa khóa để am hiểu hiện tại[18] và (theo Carr) định hình tương lai.[19]

Lịch sử đôi lúc cũng được sử dụng làm công cụ chính trị và công cụ tuyên truyền, ví dụ như ca ngợi những truyền thống cũ nhằm giúp giới cầm quyền duy trì hiện trạng hoặc phơi bày những bất công trong quá khứ để thúc đẩy thay đổi.[20] Ở dạng cực đoan, người ta cố ý bỏ qua hoặc xuyên tạc bằng chứng để tạo ra những câu chuyện hoàn toàn sai lệch, dẫn đến ngụy sử hoặc xuyên tạc lịch sử.[12][d] Một số ví dụ tiêu biểu gồm phủ nhận sự tồn tại của nạn diệt chủng Holocaust, diệt chủng Armenia, thảm sát Nam Kinh và Holodomor.[22]

Từ nguyên

Mẩu sách Lịch sử của Herodotos, một văn bản lịch sử thời Hy Lạp cổ đại[23]
Từ lịch sử trong tiếng Việt là cách đọc Hán-Việt của hai chữ 歷史 (lìshǐ).[1]

Từ history trong tiếng Anh bắt nguồn từ chữ Hy Lạp cổ ἵστωρ (histōr) tức 'người có học, thông thái'. Từ này phái sinh từ Hy Lạp cổ ἱστορία (historiā), vốn mang nghĩa rộng gắn với tra vấn nói chung và đưa ra lời chứng. Thuật ngữ sau đó được chuyển tự sang tiếng Latinh cổ điển thành historia. Vào thời Hy Lạp hóa và La Mã, ý nghĩa của thuật ngữ có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào khía cạnh tường thuật và nghệ thuật trình bày thay vì nghiên cứu và lời chứng.[24]

Từ history du nhập vào tiếng Anh trung đại vào thế kỷ 14 thông qua chữ histoire của tiếng Pháp cổ.[25] Lúc bấy giờ, nó có nghĩa là 'câu chuyện, truyện kể', gồm cả tường thuật có thật và hư cấu. Vào thế kỷ 15, nghĩa của từ này thay đổi theo hướng bao hàm nhánh tri thức nghiên cứu quá khứ đi đôi với tự sự về quá khứ.[26] Đến thế kỷ 18 và 19, chữ history dần liên hệ chặt chẽ hơn với tường thuật thực tế và tra vấn dựa trên bằng chứng cùng thời điểm với giai đoạn chuyên nghiệp hóa của nghiên cứu lịch sử, một ý nghĩa hiện còn mang tính chi phối trong cách dùng từ đương đại.[27] Ý nghĩa bao hàm cả truyện kể đơn thuần và tự sự có thật về quá khứ cũng hiện diện trong thuật ngữ lịch sử ở nhiều ngôn ngữ châu Âu khác như histoire (tiếng Pháp), storia (tiếng Ý) và Geschichte (tiếng Đức).[28]

Phương pháp
Bài chi tiết: Phương pháp lịch sử
Phương pháp lịch sử là một tập hợp các kỹ thuật mà giới sử học áp dụng để nghiên cứu và lý giải quá khứ, bao gồm các quy trình thu thập, đánh giá và tổng hợp chứng cứ.[e] Phương pháp lịch sử nhằm đảm bảo tính nghiêm ngặt, chính xác và độ tin cậy học thuật về cách lựa chọn, phân tích và diễn giải bằng chứng lịch sử.[30] Nghiên cứu lịch sử thường bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi nghiên cứu để xác định phạm vi đề tài. Một số câu hỏi nghiên cứu tập trung đơn thuần vào mô tả những gì đã xảy ra, trong khi số khác hướng đến giải thích lý do một sự kiện cụ thể xảy ra, bác bỏ giả thuyết đã có hoặc xác nhận một giả thuyết mới.[31]

Sử liệu và phê phán sử liệu
Để giải đáp câu hỏi nghiên cứu, các sử gia sử dụng nhiều loại bằng chứng khác nhau để tái hiện lại quá khứ và củng cố cho kết luận của mình. Bằng chứng lịch sử thường được chia thành nguồn sơ cấp và thứ cấp.[32] Nguồn sơ cấp là những thứ được hình thành ngay trong thời kỳ đó. Có nhiều loại nguồn sơ cấp như tài liệu chính thức, thư từ, nhật ký, lời kể của nhân chứng, ảnh chụp, bản ghi âm hoặc ghi hình. Tư liệu sơ cấp còn bao gồm dấu tích lịch sử được tìm thấy qua khảo cổ học, địa chất học và y khoa, ví dụ như hiện vật và hóa thạch lấy từ các cuộc khai quật. Nguồn sơ cấp cho ta bằng chứng trực tiếp nhất về các sự kiện quá khứ.[33]

Nguồn thứ cấp là tư liệu phân tích hoặc lý giải thông tin của tư liệu khác.[35] Việc một nguồn tài liệu được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp phụ thuộc cả vào bản chất lẫn mục đích sử dụng của tư liệu đó. Chẳng hạn, tài liệu nghiên cứu về chế độ nô lệ được viết bằng cách phân tích các tài liệu lịch sử sẽ là nguồn thứ cấp khi nói về chế độ nô lệ nhưng lại là nguồn sơ cấp về quan điểm của sử gia đó.[36][f] Một trong những tiêu chuẩn phải có của một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử đáng tin cậy là tính nhất quán với các tư liệu đã có. Nếu các nhà sử học tìm thấy những nguồn tài liệu mới, họ có thể sẽ phải sửa đổi hoặc bác bỏ những câu chuyện lịch sử đã và đang được công nhận.[38] Để tìm kiếm và tiếp cận với sử liệu sơ cấp và thứ cấp, các sử gia thường tra cứu kho lưu trữ, thư viện và bảo tàng. Kho lưu trữ đóng vai trò chủ chốt qua việc lưu lại và công khai vô số tư liệu nguyên bản đến giới nghiên cứu một cách có hệ thống và dễ tiếp cận. Nhờ những tiến bộ công nghệ, giới sử học đang ngày càng tận dụng nguồn tài nguyên trực tuyến với các cơ sở dữ liệu phong phú cùng những kỹ thuật tìm kiếm và truy cập tài liệu.[39]

Phê phán sử liệu là quá trình phân tích và đánh giá thông tin mà một tư liệu cung cấp.[g] Thông thường, quá trình này bắt đầu bằng phê phán ngoại tại, tức là đánh giá tính xác thực của sử liệu bằng cách đặt ra những câu hỏi như sử liệu này ra đời khi nào, ở đâu, ai là tác giả, mục đích người đó làm ra sử liệu là gì, sử liệu có từng bị chỉnh sửa gì sau thời điểm xuất bản hay không. Ngoài ra, phê phán ngoại tại còn bao gồm phân biệt giữa bản gốc, bản sao và bản làm giả.[41]

Phê phán nội tại là đánh giá nội dung của tư liệu, thường bắt đầu bằng việc làm rõ ý nghĩa những gì tư liệu muốn nói. Việc này bao gồm làm rõ nghĩa những từ ngữ có thể gây nhầm lẫn, hoặc nếu tài liệu viết bằng một ngôn ngữ lạ thì cần phải dịch nó ra.[h] Khi đã hiểu nội dung, bước quan trọng nhất là xác định tính chính xác: thông tin có đáng tin không, có bị bóp méo hay trình bày sai sự thật không, có đầy đủ không, có bỏ sót chi tiết quan trọng nào không. Một cách tiến hành những việc trên là đánh giá khả năng trình bày trung thực sự kiện được nghiên cứu của tác giả về mặt nguyên tắc. Ngoài ra, còn có một số phương pháp tiếp cận khác như đánh giá tầm ảnh hưởng của ý định hay thiên kiến từ tác giả và tham chiếu thông tin với các nguồn đáng tin cậy khác. Nhận biết về thiếu sót của sử liệu giúp các nhà sử học quyết định có nên tin tưởng sử liệu đó hay không, nếu có thì nên tin những khía cạnh gì và nên sử dụng nó như thế nào để xây dựng tường thuật.[43]

Tổng hợp lịch sử và các trường phái tư tưởng
Từ bước lựa chọn, phân tích và phê phán sử liệu, sử gia sẽ xác minh được một lượng lớn các luận điểm độc lập về quá khứ. Ở bước tiếp theo, đôi khi còn gọi là tổng hợp lịch sử, nhà sử học sẽ tìm hiểu cách thức liên kết những bằng chứng riêng lẻ đó thành một bức tranh tổng thể.[i] Việc xây dựng góc nhìn bao quát là cần thiết để có sự hiểu biết toàn diện về đề tài nghiên cứu. Đây là một khía cạnh sáng tạo[j] của ghi chép lịch sử nhằm tái hiện và lý giải những gì đã xảy ra thông qua việc xác định mối liên hệ giữa nhiều sự kiện khác nhau.[46] Nhờ đó, sử gia có thể xác định được những sự kiện nào đã diễn ra, nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng là gì.[47] Tuy không có kỹ thuật duy nhất nào được chấp nhận rộng rãi, giới sử học vẫn áp dụng nhiều công cụ và cách tiếp cận diễn giải trong quá trình trên.[48]

Auguste Comte là người phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng, ủng hộ tiếp cận lịch sử trên cơ sở khoa học.[49]
Một công cụ giúp khái quát và trình bày dễ hiểu các quá trình phát triển phức tạp là phân kỳ lịch sử, tức là chia một khoảng thời gian thành nhiều giai đoạn riêng biệt, mỗi giai đoạn được xác định bởi một chủ đề hoặc quá trình phát triển chủ đạo. Ví dụ, hệ thống ba thời đại thường được sử dụng để phân chia lịch sử loài người thuở đầu thành thời đại đồ đá, thời đại đồ đồng và thời đại đồ sắt dựa trên loại nguyên vật liệu và công nghệ chủ yếu đặc trưng cho từng thời kỳ.[50] Một phương pháp khác là nghiên cứu khoảng trống trong ghi chép lịch sử, tức những sự kiện đã từng xảy ra nhưng không để lại bằng chứng đáng kể nào. Những khoảng trống này có thể xuất hiện khi người đương thời cho rằng thông tin quá hiển nhiên nên không cần ghi lại, hoặc khi thông tin bị cố ý giấu giếm hay tiêu hủy.[51][k] Ngược lại, khi có sẵn các tập dữ liệu lớn thì sử gia có thể sử dụng hướng tiếp cận định lượng. Chẳng hạn, các nhà sử học kinh tế và xã hội thường áp dụng phương pháp phân tích thống kê để nhận diện quy luật và xu hướng trong phạm vi tập thể rộng lớn.[54]

Mỗi trường phái tư tưởng có quan điểm riêng về mặt phương pháp luận trong ghi chép lịch sử.[55] Những nhà sử học theo chủ nghĩa thực chứng xem nghiên cứu lịch sử là một hoạt động mang tính khoa học và cho rằng bằng chứng thực nghiệm đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc tìm kiếm chân lý khách quan.[56] Trái lại, các nhà hậu hiện đại phủ nhận tính hợp lệ của những đại tự sự vốn được cho là mang lại một chân lý khách quan duy nhất. Chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại thay vào đó đề cao bản chất chủ quan của lý giải lịch sử và xem đây là nền tảng cho sự đa dạng của các quan điểm lịch sử khác nhau.[57] Những nhà Mác-xít cho rằng mọi sự phát triển lịch sử đều bắt nguồn từ động lực kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp.[58] Trường phái Annales tập trung nghiên cứu các xu hướng kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn, lấy những phương pháp định lượng và tiếp cận liên ngành làm trọng tâm.[59] Sử học nữ quyền nghiên cứu vai trò của giới tính xã hội trong lịch sử, đặc biệt quan tâm đến việc phân tích kinh nghiệm của phụ nữ và phê phán các quan niệm mang tính phụ quyền trong chép sử truyền thống.[60]

Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu
Lịch sử là một lĩnh vực nghiên cứu rộng bao gồm nhiều phân nhánh. Một số phân nhánh tập trung vào một giai đoạn thời gian cụ thể còn số khác tập trung vào một khu vực địa lý hoặc đề tài nhất định. Một công trình nghiên cứu lịch sử thường có thể có sự kết hợp nhiều hướng chuyên môn khác nhau; chẳng hạn, một tác phẩm về lịch sử kinh tế ở Ai Cập cổ đại có sự tổng hợp các góc nhìn về mặt thời gian, không gian và chủ đề. Đối với đề tài phạm vi rộng, lượng sử liệu sơ cấp liên quan thường quá lớn để có thể khảo cứu hết, buộc sử gia phải thu hẹp tầm vực chủ đề nghiên cứu hoặc sử dụng thêm tài liệu thứ cấp để đi đến kết luận tổng quan.[61]

Theo giai đoạn
Phân chia theo trình tự thời gian là một cách tiếp cận thường gặp để sắp xếp tiến trình lịch sử rộng lớn thành nhiều phân đoạn. Việc xác định các thời kỳ thường dựa trên những đặc trưng nổi bật của một giai đoạn nhất định cùng với các sự kiện quan trọng đánh dấu sự khởi đầu hoặc kết thúc những bước phát triển đó. Tùy vào bối cảnh nghiên cứu và mức độ chi tiết mà một thời kỳ có thể kéo dài từ vài thập kỷ đến hàng thế kỷ.[62] Một hướng tiếp cận tiêu biểu là chia lịch sử thế giới thành thời tiền sử, thời kỳ cổ đại, thời kỳ trung đại, thời kỳ cận đại và thời kỳ hiện đại.[63][l] Tuy nhiên, tùy theo khu vực và chủ đề nghiên cứu mà có thể có sự khác biệt về ranh giới thời gian giữa các thời kỳ trên và giới sử học cũng có thể sử dụng cách phân kỳ hoàn toàn khác.[65] Chẳng hạn, lịch sử Trung Quốc thường được phân kỳ theo các triều đại chính,[66] trong khi lịch sử châu Mỹ lại thường được chia theo các giai đoạn tiền Colombo, thực dân và hậu thực dân.[67]

Các nhà sử học sử dụng bằng chứng từ nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau để nghiên cứu thời tiền sử, bao gồm cả hóa thạch như Lucy.[68]
Nghiên cứu thời tiền sử bao gồm khảo sát quá trình tiến hóa của các loài người cổ cách đây vài triệu năm, dẫn đến sự xuất hiện của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu khoảng 200.000 năm trước.[69] Thời gian sau đó, loài người dần di cư khỏi châu Phi để cư trú ở hầu khắp Trái Đất. Về cuối thời tiền sử, những tiến bộ về công nghệ (nhất là trong chế tác công cụ) đã khiến nhiều cộng đồng người từ bỏ lối sống du mục quen thuộc dựa vào săn bắt và hái lượm và chuyển sang lối sống ít vận động dựa trên những hoạt động nông nghiệp sơ khai.[70] Sự thiếu vắng tài liệu thành văn từ thời kỳ này để lại nhiều thách thức đối với các nhà nghiên cứu và là nền tảng để cho ra đời một phương pháp tiếp cận liên ngành trên cơ sở tổng hợp những dạng bằng chứng khác từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, nhân loại học, cổ sinh vật học và địa chất học.[71]

Giới sử gia nghiên cứu thời cổ đại khảo sát sự hình thành các nền văn minh lớn đầu tiên ở những khu vực như Lưỡng Hà, Ai Cập, lưu vực sông Ấn, Trung Quốc và Peru, bắt đầu từ khoảng năm 3500 TCN tại một số nơi. Những biến đổi phức tạp trong xã hội, kinh tế và chính trị đã tạo điều kiện cho việc phát triển các hệ thống chữ viết đầu tiên. Nhờ những thành tựu mới về nông nghiệp, lượng lương thực thặng dư đã giúp các nền văn minh trên nuôi sống được quy mô dân số ngày càng lớn, kéo theo quá trình đô thị hóa, sự thành lập nhiều mạng lưới thương mại và sự xuất hiện những đế chế khu vực. Ở giai đoạn sau của thời cổ đại, đôi khi còn gọi là thời kỳ cổ điển, các xã hội tại Trung Quốc, Ấn Độ, Ba Tư và Địa Trung Hải tiếp tục mở rộng và đạt đến đỉnh cao mới về văn hóa, khoa học và chính trị. Cùng lúc đó, nhiều hệ thống tôn giáo và tư tưởng triết học lớn như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Do Thái giáo và triết học Hy Lạp cũng được hình thành tại đây.[72]

Trong nghiên cứu về thời kỳ trung đại (bắt đầu vào khoảng năm 500 CN), giới sử học đề cập đến tầm ảnh hưởng ngày càng sâu rộng của những tôn giáo lớn. Các tôn giáo truyền đạo như Phật giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo lan tỏa nhanh chóng và trở thành tôn giáo thế giới, đánh dấu bước chuyển dịch lớn về văn hóa khi dần thay thế nhiều hệ tín ngưỡng khác. Cùng thời điểm, các mạng lưới thương mại liên khu vực phát triển mạnh mẽ, thúc đẩy sự giao lưu về công nghệ và văn hóa. Vào thế kỷ 13 và 14, đế quốc Mông Cổ xâm lược nhiều vùng lãnh thổ ở châu Á và châu Âu và trở thành thế lực thống trị hàng đầu.[73]

Các sử gia chuyên nghiên cứu thời cận đại (bắt đầu khoảng năm 1500 CN) thường tập trung phân tích quá trình trỗi dậy và thâu tóm quyền lực toàn cầu của các nước châu Âu. Những nước đế quốc thuốc súng này đã tiến hành khai phá và thực dân hóa nhiều khu vực rộng lớn trên thế giới. Hệ quả là châu Mỹ được kết nối vào mạng lưới toàn cầu, khởi đầu cho một cuộc trao đổi sinh học quy mô lớn với sự di chuyển của cả thực vật, động vật, con người và mầm bệnh.[m] Cách mạng khoa học là xúc tác cho các phát kiến lớn và tăng tốc tiến bộ công nghệ, song song với đó là nhiều bước tiến khác về tri thức như chủ nghĩa nhân văn và thời kỳ Khai Sáng, mở đường cho tiến trình thế tục hóa.[75]

Cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp có tác động sâu rộng đến đời sống kinh tế và xã hội, đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ xã hội nông nghiệp sang xã hội công nghiệp.[76]
Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử hiện đại (bắt đầu vào cuối thế kỷ 18), giới sử học quan tâm đến cách mà cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp làm chuyển dịch các nền kinh tế nhờ việc cho ra đời những phương thức sản xuất hiệu quả hơn. Các cường quốc phương Tây thành lập những đế chế thực dân rộng lớn và củng cố ưu thế nhờ công nghệ quân sự công nghiệp hóa. Sự gia tăng trao đổi hàng hóa, tư tưởng và con người đánh dấu bước đầu của quá trình toàn cầu hóa. Hàng loạt cuộc cách mạng xã hội bùng nổ chống lại các chế độ chuyên quyền và thực dân, đặt nền móng cho những thể chế dân chủ. Nhiều lĩnh vực như khoa học, công nghệ, kinh tế, mức sống và dân số tăng trưởng với tốc độ chưa từng có bất chấp tàn phá nặng nề từ hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới, vốn đã làm thay đổi căn bản cán cân quyền lực quốc tế với sự suy yếu vai trò thống trị của châu Âu.[77]

Theo vị trí địa lý
Lĩnh vực nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng có thể được phân loại theo vị trí địa lý.[78] Yếu tố địa lý đóng vai trò quan trọng trong lịch sử do có ảnh hưởng đến sản xuất thực phẩm, tài nguyên thiên nhiên, hoạt động kinh tế, ranh giới chính trị và giao lưu văn hóa.[79][n] Một số tác phẩm lịch sử có phạm vi nghiên cứu chỉ ở những khu vực nhỏ như làng xã hay khu định cư, còn số khác tập trung vào các vùng lãnh thổ rộng lớn trải khắp toàn bộ châu lục, ví dụ như lịch sử châu Phi, châu Á, châu Âu, châu Mỹ và châu Đại Dương.[81]

Quần thể kim tự tháp Giza đại diện cho di sản lâu đời của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại.[82]
Lịch sử châu Phi khởi đầu với nghiên cứu về sự tiến hóa của người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu.[83] Các nhà sử học cổ đại mô tả quá trình phát minh chữ viết và cái nôi của nền văn minh Ai Cập cổ đại vào thiên niên kỷ 4 TCN.[84] Trong thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, nhiều nền văn minh và vương quốc tiêu biểu khác được hình thành tại Nubia, Axum, Carthage, Ghana, Mali và Songhay.[85] Hồi giáo bắt đầu lan truyền khắp Bắc Phi vào thế kỷ 7 CN và trở thành đức tin lớn nhất ở nhiều đế quốc. Trong khi đó, hoạt động thương mại dọc theo tuyến xuyên Sahara phát triển mạnh.[86] Từ thế kỷ 15, hàng triệu người châu Phi bị bắt làm nô lệ và đưa sang châu Mỹ trong khuôn khổ cuộc buôn bán nô lệ Đại Tây Dương.[87] Phần lớn châu lục rơi vào ách đô hộ của các cường quốc châu Âu vào cuối thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20.[88] Trước làn sóng chủ nghĩa dân tộc, các nước châu Phi dần giành lại độc lập trong giai đoạn sau Thế chiến II, một thời kỳ chứng kiến tiến bộ kinh tế, tăng trưởng nhanh về dân số và đấu tranh vì ổn định chính trị.[89]

Giới sử học nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Á nhận thấy người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 100.000 năm trước.[90] Châu Á được xem là một trong những cái nôi của nền văn minh nhân loại với sự ra đời một số nền văn minh cổ đại đầu tiên ở Lưỡng Hà, lưu vực sông Ấn và Trung Quốc bắt đầu từ thiên niên kỷ thứ 4 và thứ 3 TCN.[91] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo, các nền văn minh ở châu Á lục địa sản sinh ra tất cả các tôn giáo thế giới lớn và một số truyền thống triết học tiêu biểu như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Nho giáo, Đạo giáo, Kitô giáo và Hồi giáo.[92] Khoảng thời gian này còn chứng kiến việc con đường tơ lụa được thành lập nhằm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho thương mại và trao đổi văn hóa trên khắp lục địa Á-Âu, cùng với đó là sự hình thành các đế chế hùng mạnh như đế quốc Mông Cổ.[93] Ảnh hưởng của châu Âu dần gia tăng trong những thế kỷ tiếp theo, mở ra thời kỳ hiện đại, và đạt đỉnh vào thế kỷ 19 và đầu thế kỷ 20 khi nhiều khu vực của châu Á rơi vào ách cai trị thực dân đến khi Thế chiến II kết thúc.[94] Sau khi giành lại độc lập, các quốc gia châu Á bước vào giai đoạn hiện đại hóa với nền kinh tế và quy mô dân số tăng trưởng nhanh.[95]

Do tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến văn hóa và triết học phương Tây, Hy Lạp cổ đại là một đối tượng nghiên cứu quan trọng đối với các nhà sử học châu Âu.[96]
Trong nghiên cứu lịch sử châu Âu, các sử gia mô tả sự xuất hiện của những người hiện đại về mặt giải phẫu đầu tiên cách đây khoảng 45.000 năm.[97] Nhiều công trình nghiên cứu tập trung tìm hiểu những đóng góp quan trọng từ Hy Lạp cổ đại cho văn hóa, triết học và chính trị gắn liền với thế giới phương Tây vào thiên niên kỷ thứ nhất TCN,[96] cũng như cảm hứng từ di sản văn hóa của nền văn minh này đối với đế quốc La Mã và Đông La Mã.[98] Thời kỳ trung đại bắt đầu với việc đế quốc Tây La Mã sụp đổ vào thế kỷ 5 CN và được đánh dấu bởi làn sóng lan truyền Kitô giáo.[99] Từ thế kỷ 15, công cuộc khai phá và thuộc địa hóa từ châu Âu đã làm kết nối các châu lục lại với nhau, trong khi những bước tiến văn hóa, tri thức và khoa học thúc đẩy sự thay đổi của nhiều xã hội phương Tây.[100] Từ cuối thế kỷ 18 đến đầu thế kỷ 20, thế thống trị toàn cầu của châu Âu được củng cố bởi cuộc cách mạng công nghiệp và sự thành lập các thuộc địa lớn.[101] Thế thống trị đó chấm dứt do hậu quả thảm khốc của hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới.[102] Đến thời Chiến tranh Lạnh, châu lục bị chia cắt thành một khối phía Tây và một khối phía Đông. Cả hai khối cùng thúc đẩy hợp tác chính trị và kinh tế sâu rộng hơn sau khi Chiến tranh Lạnh kết thúc.[103]

Giới sử học khảo sát lịch sử châu Mỹ ghi nhận sự hiện diện những con người đầu tiên vào khoảng 20.000 đến 15.000 năm trước.[104] Châu Mỹ là cái nôi của vài trong số các nền văn minh sớm nhất như văn minh Norte Chico ở Nam Mỹ và văn minh Maya và Olmec ở Trung Mỹ.[105] Thiên niên kỷ tiếp theo chứng kiến sự xuất hiện nhiều đế chế lớn như Teotihuacan, Aztec và đế quốc Inca.[106] Sau khi người châu Âu gia nhập lục địa từ cuối thế kỷ 15, nhiều căn bệnh truyền nhiễm mới lan rộng dẫn đến dân số sụt giảm nghiêm trọng. Việc này cùng với quá trình thực dân hóa đã khiến các đế chế lớn sụp đổ và làm cấu trúc nhân khẩu học cũng như diện mạo văn hóa thay đổi toàn diện.[107] Các phong trào độc lập vào thế kỷ 18 và 19 dẫn đến việc hình thành những quốc gia mới trên khắp châu Mỹ.[108] Đến thế kỷ 20, Mỹ vươn lên trở thành cường quốc toàn cầu và đóng vai trò nổi bật trong cục diện Chiến tranh Lạnh.[109]

Trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử châu Đại Dương, các sử gia nhận định con người đã xuất hiện tại đây khoảng 60.000 đến 50.000 năm trước.[110] Quá trình phát triển các xã hội và nền văn hóa khu vực đa dạng được ghi nhận đầu tiên ở Úc và Papua New Guinea, sau mới đến các đảo khác thuộc Thái Bình Dương.[111] Sự gia nhập của người châu Âu vào thế kỷ 16 mang đến nhiều biến đổi sâu sắc, và đến cuối thế kỷ 19 phần lớn khu vực đã bị các nước phương Tây kiểm soát.[112] Châu Đại Dương đã tham gia nhiều cuộc xung đột trong hai cuộc chiến tranh thế giới và trải qua giai đoạn phi thực dân hóa trong thời hậu chiến.[113]

Theo đề tài
Giới sử học thường giới hạn phạm vi khảo cứu về một chủ đề cụ thể.[114] Một số học giả đề xuất phân chia tổng quát thành ba đề tài chính: lịch sử chính trị, lịch sử kinh tế và lịch sử xã hội. Tuy nhiên, ranh giới giữa các phân nhánh này là mơ hồ và quan hệ giữa chúng với các phân nhánh đề tài khác như lịch sử trí thức không phải lúc nào cũng rõ ràng.[115]

Lịch sử chính trị nghiên cứu tổ chức quyền lực trong xã hội, tìm hiểu cách thức ra đời, phát triển và tác động qua lại của các cấu trúc quyền lực. Nhà nước hoặc các cấu trúc tương tự nhà nước là đối tượng trọng tâm của lĩnh vực nghiên cứu này xuyên suốt phần lớn lịch sử được ghi chép. Lịch sử chính trị phân tích cơ chế tổ chức nội bộ của một quốc gia, ví dụ như bè phái, đảng phái, tầng lớp lãnh đạo và các thể chế chính trị khác. Phân nhánh này còn nghiên cứu về việc hoạch định và thực thi chính sách cũng như quan hệ giữa nhà nước với các quốc gia khác.[116] Lịch sử chính trị là một trong những phân nhánh lâu đời nhất của lịch sử do đã được các sử gia như Herodotos và Thucydides nghiên cứu từ thời cổ đại, trong khi các lĩnh vực con tiêu biểu khác chỉ mới được công nhận là phân nhánh độc lập vào thế kỷ trước.[117]

Lịch sử quân sự nghiên cứu về xung đột vũ trang, bao gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ quân sự như máy bắn đá.[118]
Lịch sử ngoại giao và lịch sử quân sự có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử chính trị. Lịch sử ngoại giao khảo sát quan hệ quốc tế giữa các quốc gia, bao gồm những vấn đề liên quan đến chính sách đối ngoại như đàm phán, toan tính chiến lược, hiệp ước và xung đột giữa các nước cũng như vai trò của các tổ chức quốc tế trong những quy trình này.[119] Lịch sử quân sự phân tích sự hình thành, phát triển và tác động của các cuộc xung đột vũ trang trong lịch sử thế giới. Phạm vi nghiên cứu của lịch sử quân sự bao gồm phân tích về các sự kiện cụ thể, chẳng hạn như tìm hiểu một trận chiến hay nguyên nhân gây ra một cuộc chiến tranh. Lịch sử quân sự còn xem xét tổng quan về sự phát triển của chiến tranh, trong đó gồm những tiến bộ về công nghệ, chiến lược, chiến thuật, hậu cần và thể chế quân sự.[120]

Lịch sử kinh tế nghiên cứu cách thức sản xuất, trao đổi và tiêu thụ hàng hóa. Lĩnh vực này bao quát những khía cạnh kinh tế như sử dụng đất, lao động và tư bản, cung và cầu hàng hóa, chi phí và tư liệu sản xuất, phân phối thu nhập và của cải. Các nhà sử học kinh tế thường chú trọng phân tích những xu hướng chung mang tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như lạm phát, hơn là hành động và quyết định của cá nhân. Nếu có đủ dữ liệu, họ thường sử dụng các phương pháp định lượng như phân tích thống kê. Ở những giai đoạn trước thời kỳ hiện đại, dữ liệu có sẵn thường bị hạn chế, buộc giới sử học kinh tế phải phụ thuộc vào các nguồn tài liệu khan hiếm và ngoại suy thông tin từ chúng.[121]

Lịch sử xã hội là một lĩnh vực rộng lớn chuyên nghiên cứu những hiện tượng xã hội, song định nghĩa chính xác của nó chưa có sự thống nhất. Một số nhà lý thuyết xem đây là ngành nghiên cứu về cuộc sống thường ngày ngoài phạm vi chính trị và kinh tế, bao gồm tập quán văn hóa, cấu trúc gia đình, quan hệ cộng đồng và giáo dục. Một hướng tiếp cận mật thiết chú trọng nhiều hơn vào khám phá kinh nghiệm từ các nhóm xã hội cụ thể như giai cấp, chủng tộc, giới tính hoặc nhóm tuổi đối với thế giới mình đang sinh sống. Các cách hiểu khác coi lịch sử xã hội là nghiên cứu về những vấn đề xã hội như đói nghèo, bệnh tật và tội phạm, hoặc mở rộng phạm vi để xem xét sự phát triển của toàn thể xã hội nói chung.[122] Một số lĩnh vực có liên hệ gần gũi với lịch sử xã hội bao gồm lịch sử văn hóa, lịch sử giới tính và lịch sử tôn giáo.[123]

Lịch sử trí thức là lịch sử về tư tưởng, chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình phát triển của các khái niệm, triết lý và ý thức hệ. Nhánh này đặc biệt quan tâm đến các lĩnh vực học thuật nhưng mặt khác còn bao gồm nghiên cứu về tín ngưỡng và định kiến trong đời sống của con người bình thường. Bên cạnh việc tìm hiểu các phong trào trí thức, lịch sử trí thức còn khảo sát bối cảnh văn hóa và xã hội đã góp phần định hình nên những phong trào đó cũng như ảnh hưởng từ chúng đối với các tiến trình lịch sử khác.[124] Là hai trong những lĩnh vực liên quan mật thiết, lịch sử triết học phân tích sự phát triển của tư tưởng triết lý[125] còn lịch sử khoa học nghiên cứu quá trình biến đổi của lý thuyết và thực tiễn khoa học, chẳng hạn như những đóng góp khoa học của Charles Darwin và Albert Einstein.[126] Lịch sử học nghệ thuật là một bộ môn khác có liên hệ với lịch sử trí thức, chuyên suy xét các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trong lịch sử cùng với sự phát triển của các hình thức, phong cách và trào lưu nghệ thuật. Lịch sử học nghệ thuật bao gồm bàn luận về bối cảnh văn hóa, xã hội và chính trị của sáng tạo nghệ thuật.[127]

Lịch sử môi trường nghiên cứu quan hệ giữa con người và môi trường sống, hướng đến am hiểu cách mà loài người và phần còn lại của tự nhiên tác động lẫn nhau trong chiều dài lịch sử.[128] Một số phân nhánh khác theo đề tài bao gồm lịch sử hiến pháp, lịch sử luật pháp, lịch sử đô thị, lịch sử kinh doanh, lịch sử công nghệ, lịch sử y học, lịch sử giáo dục và lịch sử dân tộc.[129]

Lĩnh vực khác
Một số phân nhánh của lịch sử được đặc trưng bởi phương pháp mà chúng áp dụng. Chẳng hạn, lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử phụ thuộc lần lượt vào các phương pháp định lượng và phương tiện truyền thông kỹ thuật số trong nghiên cứu.[130] Lịch sử so sánh đối chiếu các hiện tượng lịch sử thuộc những thời kỳ, khu vực hoặc nền văn hóa phân biệt để xem xét những điểm giống và khác nhau giữa chúng.[131] Không giống như hầu hết phân nhánh khác, lịch sử truyền miệng dựa vào lời kể thay vì tài liệu ghi chép, bao hàm tường thuật nhân chứng, chứng cứ nghe nói lại và truyền thuyết cộng đồng. Lịch sử truyền miệng phản ánh kinh nghiệm cá nhân, sự diễn giải và trí nhớ của những người dân thường, cho thấy tính chủ quan trong cách con người ghi nhớ lịch sử.[132] Lịch sử phản thực tế sử dụng tư duy phản thực tế để khảo sát những hướng đi khác của lịch sử và khám phá những gì có thể sẽ xảy ra dưới những điều kiện khác nhau.[133] Một vài phân nhánh nhất định của lịch sử được tách bạch dựa trên quan điểm lý thuyết, ví dụ như lịch sử Mác-xít và lịch sử nữ quyền.[134]

Lịch sử thế giới nghiên cứu lịch sử ở cấp độ toàn cầu, kết hợp với toàn bộ lịch sử loài người.[135]
Một số cách phân chia lĩnh vực tập trung vào tầm vực của đề tài nghiên cứu. Lịch sử Vĩ đại là nhánh có tầm vực rộng nhất, bao hàm mọi thứ từ Vụ Nổ Lớn cho đến hiện tại, kết hợp các yếu tố của vũ trụ học, địa chất học, sinh học và nhân loại học.[9] Lịch sử thế giới là một phân nhánh khác với phạm vi rộng, khảo sát toàn thể lịch sử loài người bắt đầu từ sự tiến hóa của các loài giống người.[135] Các thuật ngữ lịch sử vĩ mô hay lịch sử vi mô chỉ những cấp độ quy mô phân tích khác nhau, dao động từ các quy luật mang tính toàn cầu đến nghiên cứu chi tiết về bối cảnh địa phương, cộng đồng nhỏ, gia đình, cá nhân hoặc sự kiện cụ thể.[136] Có liên hệ mật thiết với lịch sử vi mô là thể loại tiểu sử lịch sử, chuyên thuật lại cuộc đời của một cá nhân trong bối cảnh thời đại và di sản mà nhân vật để lại.[137]

Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm các hoạt động nhằm trình bày lịch sử đến công chúng. Việc này thường diễn ra bên ngoài phạm vi học thuật truyền thống ở những bối cảnh như bảo tàng, di tích lịch sử, du lịch di sản và truyền thông đại chúng.[138]

Quá trình phát triển của bộ môn
Trước khi có chữ viết, tri thức lịch sử được lưu truyền chủ yếu qua truyền miệng.[139] Những bản ghi chép lịch sử sớm nhất thường đan xen giữa các sự kiện có thật với yếu tố thần thoại, chẳng hạn như Sử thi Gilgamesh từ Lưỡng Hà cổ đại và Odyssey, một tác phẩm của Hy Lạp cổ đại được cho là do Homeros sáng tác.[140] Xuất bản vào thế kỷ 5 TCN, cuốn Lịch sử của Herodotos[o] là một trong những công trình nền tảng của truyền thống sử học phương Tây, trong đó tác giả chú trọng vào khảo cứu dựa trên lý tính và bằng chứng thay vì những câu chuyện của Homeros và các thi sĩ khác.[142] Thucydides kế thừa và phát triển phương pháp của Herodotos nhưng tập trung nhiều hơn vào các tiến trình phát triển chính trị và quân sự cụ thể, trái ngược với phạm vi rộng cùng các yếu tố dân tộc chí trong tác phẩm của Herodotos.[143] Sử luận La Mã chịu ảnh hưởng lớn từ truyền thống Hy Lạp, kết hợp giữa việc ghi chép sự kiện và phán xét đạo đức về các nhân vật lịch sử.[p] Các sử gia La Mã thời kỳ đầu sử dụng phong cách biên niên sử, sắp xếp các sự kiện theo từng năm và hầu như không bình luận gì thêm, còn những tác giả về sau ưu tiên nhiều hơn vào tường thuật và phân tích.[145]

Sử ký của Tư Mã Thiên là một trong những tự sự lịch sử công phu ra đời sớm nhất về lịch sử Trung Quốc và thế giới theo hiểu biết của người Trung Hoa.[146]
Một truyền thống chép sử lớn khác ra đời tại Trung Quốc cổ đại với các tiền thân đầu tiên xuất hiện vào cuối thiên niên kỷ thứ 2 TCN. Truyền thống đó xem biên niên sử là hình thái cao nhất của ghi chép lịch sử và đề cao việc kiểm chứng dựa trên sử liệu. Tập quán này gắn liền với triết lý Nho gia và có liên hệ chặt chẽ với bộ máy chính quyền dưới hình thức triều đại cầm quyền. Các sử gia Trung Hoa đã phát triển một phương pháp chép sử mạch lạc và có hệ thống sớm hơn so với những nơi khác.[147] Công trình của Tư Mã Thiên có ảnh hưởng đặc biệt; phương pháp nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ cùng việc thêm thắt những quan điểm khác với chính thống từ ông đã định hình nên hệ tiêu chuẩn cho sử luận về sau.[148] Ở Ấn Độ cổ đại, tự sự lịch sử có sự gắn bó mật thiết với tôn giáo. Chúng thường kết hợp sự kiện có thật với các yếu tố siêu nhiên, điển hình như trong Mahabharata.[149]

Tại châu Âu thời trung đại, lịch sử chủ yếu được giáo sĩ ghi lại dưới hình thức biên niên sử. Giới sử gia Kitô giáo lấy truyền thống Hy-La và Do Thái làm cảm hứng để tường thuật lại quá khứ như một phần trong kế hoạch thiêng liêng do Chúa định sẵn.[150] Những nhân vật tiêu biểu góp phần làm nên tập quán này gồm sử gia Eusebius và Bêđa cùng nhà thần học Augustinô thành Hippo.[151] Ở thế giới Hồi giáo, chép sử cũng chịu ảnh hưởng tương tự từ tôn giáo, lấy góc nhìn Hồi giáo để diễn giải quá khứ. Sử luận Hồi giáo nhấn mạnh vào chuỗi truyền tin để bảo đảm độ tin cậy của tự sự lịch sử.[152] Al-Tabari là tác giả của một bộ sử ký công phu, kéo dài từ thuở khai thiên lập địa đến thời đại đương thời với ông. Ibn Khaldun phản tư các vấn đề nền tảng của chép sử về mặt triết lý, ví dụ như những quy luật phổ quát chi phối các tiến trình lịch sử cũng như giới hạn của chân lý lịch sử.[153]

Vào thời nhà Đường (618–907 CN) tại Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử ngày càng được thể chế hóa sâu hơn khi một cơ quan chuyên trách được thành lập năm 629 CN. Cơ quan này đã giám sát công tác biên soạn thực lục, những bộ ghi chép chi tiết làm nền tảng cho bộ chính sử quốc gia. Giới sử gia nhà Đường đề cao sự khác biệt giữa bản thân các sự kiện đã xảy ra và cách mà chúng được phản ánh trong các văn bản lịch sử.[154] Chép sử thời nhà Tống (960–1279 CN) diễn ra qua nhiều thể loại như bách khoa thư, tiểu sử và tiểu thuyết lịch sử, đồng thời lịch sử cũng trở thành một môn học chính trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc.[155] Tại Nhật Bản, một truyền thống chép sử riêng bắt đầu hình thành vào thế kỷ 8 CN, chịu ảnh hưởng từ mô hình Trung Hoa. Tương tự như ở Trung Quốc, ghi chép lịch sử tại đây gắn bó mật thiết với hoàng thất nhưng các nhà sử học Nhật Bản ít chú trọng hơn vào đánh giá phê phán sử liệu.[156]

Đến thời Phục Hưng và cận đại (khoảng năm 1500 đến 1800), các truyền thống sử học dần trở nên gắn kết và ảnh hưởng lẫn nhau.[157] Từ thế kỷ 14 ở châu Âu, phong trào Phục Hưng đã đánh dấu sự chuyển đổi từ quan điểm tôn giáo đặc trưng của thời Trung Cổ sang mối quan tâm mới đối với di sản cổ điển Hy Lạp và La Mã. Các nhà nhân văn Phục Hưng sử dụng phương pháp phê phán sử liệu tinh vi nhằm xem xét lại những tác phẩm sử ký tôn giáo trước đây, qua đó góp phần thúc đẩy quá trình thế tục hóa trong ghi chép lịch sử. Từ thế kỷ 15 đến 17, giới sử học nhấn mạnh nhiều hơn vào vai trò mô phạm của lịch sử và sử dụng lịch sử như một công cụ để củng cố trật tự xã hội hiện có hoặc phục hồi lý tưởng về quá khứ. Khi máy in ép được phát minh, tài liệu viết trở nên dễ tiếp cận với chi phí phải chăng và việc tiếp nhận tri thức lịch sử dần được mở rộng ra bên ngoài giới giáo sĩ và quý tộc. Cùng lúc đó, tư tưởng hướng kinh nghiệm gắn với cuộc cách mạng khoa học đã làm dấy lên hoài nghi về khả năng đạt tới chân lý lịch sử phổ quát.[158] Trong thời kỳ Khai Sáng vào thế kỷ 18, ghi chép lịch sử chịu tác động mạnh mẽ từ chủ nghĩa duy lý và chủ nghĩa hoài nghi. Thời gian này, các nhà sử học tìm cách khai phá những quy luật và ý nghĩa sâu xa trong tiến trình lịch sử với mục đích thách thức quyền lực và giáo điều truyền thống bằng lý trí và phương pháp thực nghiệm. Ngoài ra, phạm vi của nghiên cứu lịch sử cũng được mở rộng thêm và tập trung ngày càng nhiều vào các đề tài xã hội và kinh tế cũng như so sánh các nền văn hóa khác nhau.[159]

Ở Trung Quốc thời nhà Minh (1368–1644), sự quan tâm của công chúng đối với các ấn phẩm ghi chép lịch sử gia tăng rõ rệt. Bên cạnh những công trình do sử quan biên soạn để tiếp nối thực lục của các triều đại trước, nhiều tác phẩm phi chính thức của các học giả tư nhân cũng phát triển mạnh. Những học giả này thường thể hiện phong cách sáng tạo hơn và đôi khi đưa ra diễn giải và tường thuật khác với chính thống.[160] Tại thế giới Hồi giáo, nhiều tập quán chép sử mới ra đời tại đế quốc Safavid, Mogul và Ottoman.[161] Trong khi đó tại châu Mỹ, các nhà thám hiểm châu Âu bắt đầu ghi lại và lý giải những tường thuật lịch sử của các dân tộc bản địa. Những câu chuyện này vốn được lưu truyền qua hình thức truyền miệng hoặc ký hiệu tượng hình và thường mang đến cách nhìn khác biệt so với quan điểm lịch sử của châu Âu đương thời.[162]

Leopold von Ranke đã cách mạng hóa tiêu chuẩn học thuật lịch sử nhờ cho ra đời quy trình đánh giá sử liệu sơ cấp kỹ lưỡng.[163]
Ghi chép lịch sử có sự chuyển dịch theo hướng chuyên nghiệp hóa và khoa học hóa vào thế kỷ 19. Sau công trình của Leopold von Ranke, một phương pháp phê phán sử liệu có hệ thống được thừa nhận rộng rãi và nhiều cơ sở học thuật chuyên về lịch sử như khoa ngành đại học, hiệp hội chuyên môn và tạp chí được thành lập.[164] Cùng với tinh thần khoa học của thời đại, Auguste Comte phát triển chủ nghĩa thực chứng và đặt ra mục tiêu khám phá những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử tương tự như với các định luật trong tự nhiên.[165] Dựa trên triết lý của Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx đã đề xuất một quy luật chung như vậy trong lý thuyết về chủ nghĩa duy vật lịch sử, cho rằng lực lượng kinh tế và đấu tranh giai cấp là nguyên nhân cơ bản dẫn đến thay đổi lịch sử.[166] Một bước phát triển quan trọng khác trong giai đoạn này là sự lan tỏa của các phương pháp sử luận châu Âu, vốn dần trở thành hướng tiếp cận chủ đạo trong nghiên cứu học thuật về quá khứ trên thế giới.[167]

Trong thế kỷ 20, những giả định và phương pháp lịch sử truyền thống dần bị đặt nghi vấn, còn tầm vực của nghiên cứu lịch sử tiếp tục được mở rộng.[168] Trường phái Annales kết hợp tri thức về xã hội học, tâm lý học và kinh tế học để nghiên cứu các tiến trình dài hạn.[169] Các chế độ chuyên chế như Đức Quốc Xã, Liên Xô và Trung Quốc thao túng tự sự lịch sử vì mục đích ý thức hệ.[170] Nhiều sử gia lựa chọn nghiên cứu với góc nhìn độc đáo, tập trung vào kinh nghiệm của các nhóm thiểu số xã hội qua những hướng tiếp cận như lịch sử từ dưới lên, lịch sử vi mô, lịch sử truyền miệng và sử học nữ quyền.[171] Chủ nghĩa hậu thực dân tìm cách phê phán và làm suy yếu sự bá chủ của cách tiếp cận phương Tây, còn chủ nghĩa hậu hiện đại bác bỏ luận điểm về sự tồn tại một chân lý lịch sử phổ quát duy nhất.[172] Giới sử học trí thức khảo sát quá trình phát triển của các hệ tư tưởng trong lịch sử.[173] Đến nửa sau của thế kỷ, những nỗ lực mới trong biên soạn lịch sử thế giới với quy mô toàn cầu đã thu hút nhiều sự chú ý, trong khi các thành tựu công nghệ trở thành động lực cho sự phát triển của lịch sử định lượng và lịch sử điện tử.[174]

Các lĩnh vực liên quan
Sử luận
Bài chi tiết: Sử luận

Ibn Khaldun là một nhân vật tiêu biểu trong sử luận Hồi giáo.[175]
Sử luận là nghiên cứu về các phương pháp và sự phát triển của nghiên cứu lịch sử. Nhà sử luận suy xét cách thức mà sử gia tiến hành nghiên cứu và viết sử, dẫn đến đây là một siêu lý thuyết dưới dạng lịch sử của lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ sử luận theo nghĩa khác để chỉ tường thuật được ghi chép về quá khứ.[176]

Một chủ đề cốt lõi trong sử luận dưới góc độ siêu lý thuyết tập trung vào chuẩn mực của bằng chứng và luận cứ trong khảo cứu lịch sử. Giới sử luận nghiên cứu và hệ thống hóa cách thức sử gia sử dụng tư liệu để xây dựng nên tự sự về quá khứ, trong đó có việc phân tích những giả thiết lý giải làm cơ sở cho quá trình xây dựng tự sự. Một số vấn đề khác có liên quan bao gồm văn phong và thủ pháp tu từ được trình bày trong các tác phẩm lịch sử.[177]

Qua việc so sánh công trình của các sử gia, giới sử luận có thể xác định trường phái tư tưởng dựa trên phương pháp nghiên cứu, giả định và phong cách chung.[178] Chẳng hạn, nhà sử luận khảo sát đặc trưng của trường phái Annales như việc sử dụng dữ liệu định lượng từ nhiều bộ môn hay mối quan tâm chủ yếu đến các quá trình kinh tế và xã hội dài hạn.[179] Sự so sánh còn mở rộng cho toàn thể thời kỳ từ cổ đại đến hiện đại. Bằng cách này, nhà sử luận có thể vạch ra tiến trình phát triển của lịch sử với tư cách một môn học thuật, từ đó cho thấy các phương pháp, đề tài và mục tiêu nghiên cứu chủ đạo đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.[180]

Triết học lịch sử
Bài chi tiết: Triết học lịch sử
Triết học lịch sử[q] suy xét những nền tảng lý thuyết của lịch sử. Bộ môn này quan tâm cả về bản thân quá khứ như là một chuỗi các sự kiện liên kết lẫn nhau và về lĩnh vực học thuật chuyên nghiên cứu quá trình đó. Những hiểu biết và cách tiếp cận từ một số phân nhánh triết học khác như siêu hình học, tri thức luận, thông diễn học và luân lý học có ảnh hưởng nhất định đến triết học lịch sử.[182]

Khi suy xét quá trình lịch sử, triết gia khám phá những thực thể cơ bản làm nên các hiện tượng lịch sử. Một số cách tiếp cận phụ thuộc chủ yếu vào niềm tin và hành động của cá nhân còn số khác bao hàm cả tập thể và các thực thể chung khác như văn minh, thiết chế, ý thức hệ và lực lượng xã hội.[183] Một chủ đề liên quan quan tâm bản chất của các cơ chế nhân quả liên kết những sự kiện lịch sử với nguyên nhân và hệ quả của chúng.[184] Một quan điểm cho rằng có những quy luật tổng quát của lịch sử để xác định hướng tiếp diễn của sự kiện, tương tự như các định luật trong khoa học tự nhiên. Theo một góc nhìn khác, quan hệ nhân quả giữa các sự kiện lịch sử là duy nhất và được định hình bởi những yếu tố tùy cơ.[185] Trước đây, một số nhà triết học đã đưa ra luận cứ rằng hướng đi tổng quát của chiều dài lịch sử luôn tuân theo những quy luật lớn. Theo một luận điểm, lịch sử có tính tuần hoàn, tức là ở quy mô đủ lớn thì các sự kiện riêng lẻ hoặc xu hướng chung luôn lặp lại theo chu kỳ. Một lý thuyết khác khẳng định lịch sử là một quy trình tuyến tính có mục đích, đang chuyển động tới một mục tiêu xác định trước.[186][r]

Các chủ đề triết học lịch sử và sử luận có điểm tương đồng do chúng cùng quan tâm đến tiêu chuẩn của lý luận lịch sử. Nhà sử luận thường tập trung nhiều vào mô tả các phương pháp và tiến trình phát triển cụ thể trong nghiên cứu lịch sử. Trái lại, nhà triết học lịch sử có thiên hướng khám phá những quy luật tổng quát hơn, bao gồm đặt ra những câu hỏi đánh giá về việc phương pháp và giả thiết nào là đúng đắn.[188] Lý luận lịch sử đôi khi được vận dụng làm phương pháp giải thích hiện tượng trong triết học và các bộ môn khác. Phương pháp này, vốn hay gọi là chủ nghĩa lịch sử, lập luận rằng hiểu biết về một sự vật hay hiện tượng nào đó đòi hỏi phải nắm được bối cảnh lịch sử đặc thù hoặc quá trình tiến hóa của nó. Ví dụ, chủ nghĩa lịch sử về chân lý cho rằng chân lý phụ thuộc vào hoàn cảnh lịch sử, tức là không thể tồn tại chân lý xuyên lịch sử. Chủ nghĩa lịch sử tương phản với các hướng tiếp cận tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết vượt thời gian và phổ quát về chủ thể.[189]

Khách quan lịch sử
Nhiều tranh cãi trong triết học lịch sử xoay quanh khả năng tồn tại một tường thuật khách quan về lịch sử. Nhiều nhà lý thuyết nhận định lý tưởng đó là không thể đạt được và chỉ ra nguyên nhân nằm ở bản chất chủ quan trong cách lý giải sự kiện, khía cạnh tự sự của lịch sử cũng như ảnh hưởng của giá trị và thiên kiến cá nhân trong quan điểm và hành động của các nhân vật lịch sử và nhà sử học. Theo một góc nhìn, một số dữ kiện nhất định có tính khách quan, chẳng hạn như dữ kiện về thời điểm xảy ra hạn hán hoặc quân đội nào bị đánh bại. Song, góc nhìn này không đảm bảo tính khách quan tổng quát do sử gia vẫn phải lý giải và tổng hợp dữ kiện để đi đến một tự sự chung phản ánh các xu hướng và tiến trình phát triển lớn.[190] Vì vậy, một số nhà sử học như G. M. Trevelyan và Keith Jenkins đã khẳng định toàn bộ lịch sử đều có thiên kiến và cho rằng tự sự lịch sử không thể tách rời khỏi những giả định chủ quan và phán xét giá trị.[191]

Một số cách nhìn gắn với chủ nghĩa duy thực, chủ nghĩa kinh nghiệm và chủ nghĩa tái thiết[192] xem lịch sử là sự tìm kiếm chân lý hoặc tri thức, những gì mà chúng xem là có thể phục dựng được qua việc đánh giá nghiêm ngặt và diễn giải cẩn trọng các bằng chứng.[193][s] Nhiều học giả khác phê phán quan điểm đó, nhấn mạnh vào bản chất chủ quan và thiên vị của tri thức lịch sử.[t] Những nhà chủ nghĩa quan điểm cho rằng quan điểm lịch sử vốn dĩ đã có tính chủ quan do đòi hỏi phải chọn lọc sử liệu hay nghiên cứu cụ thể và xác định thông tin nào có thể coi là sự thật lịch sử. Họ lập luận mọi phát biểu chỉ có thể mang tính khách quan trong phạm vi nội tại hoặc khi xét tương đối với một trong nhiều góc nhìn lịch sử cạnh tranh lẫn nhau.[198] Một cách nhìn theo chủ nghĩa hoài nghi hoặc thuyết tương đối cực đoan hơn còn khẳng định không có tri thức lịch sử nào có thể được chứng tỏ là khách quan.[199][u] Sự nhấn mạnh về tính chủ quan đó đã được mở rộng trong các lý thuyết hậu hiện đại, vốn nhận định con người không thể nhận thức quá khứ một cách khách quan bởi ý nghĩa của lịch sử thực chất được kiến tạo qua văn bản do con người sáng tạo ra với ngôn ngữ "cấu thành nên thế giới theo cách mà chúng ta nhận thức nó".[201][v] Đáp lại xu hướng trên, các nhà tân duy thực khẳng định lại vai trò trung tâm của phương pháp luận kinh nghiệm trong phân tích lịch sử. Họ thừa nhận sức ảnh hưởng của đánh giá chủ quan nhưng tin rằng chân lý lịch sử vẫn có khả năng đạt tới được.[203][w]

Giáo dục

Lịch sử là môn bắt buộc tại trường học ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204]
Lịch sử là một bộ phận trong chương trình học tại trường phổ thông ở hầu hết quốc gia.[204] Giáo dục lịch sử giai đoạn đầu hướng tới khơi dậy sự hứng thú cho học sinh về quá khứ và giúp học sinh làm quen với các khái niệm cơ bản của tư tưởng lịch sử. Bằng việc xây dựng nhận thức lịch sử nền tảng, môn lịch sử hướng đến nuôi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc cá nhân và cộng đồng trên cơ sở hiểu biết về nguồn gốc văn hóa.[205] Môn học thường đi theo hình thức tự sự qua việc trình bày những câu chuyện đơn giản, tập trung vào các nhân vật lịch sử hoặc nguồn gốc của ngày lễ, lễ hội và tập quán địa phương.[206] Giáo dục lịch sử nâng cao ở trường trung học bao hàm phạm vi đề tài rộng hơn, từ lịch sử cổ đại đến hiện đại ở cả cấp độ địa phương và toàn cầu. Giai đoạn giáo dục này còn nhằm giúp học sinh làm quen với các phương pháp nghiên cứu lịch sử, bao gồm năng lực lý giải và đánh giá phê phán luận điểm lịch sử.[207]

Có nhiều phương pháp giảng dạy được giáo viên lịch sử áp dụng, bao gồm thuyết trình về các tiến trình phát triển lịch sử, đặt câu hỏi để tạo sự tương tác và kích thích tư duy phản biện, hoặc tổ chức thảo luận nhóm về các đề tài lịch sử. Học sinh làm việc trực tiếp với sử liệu để học cách phân tích và lý giải bằng chứng ở cả hình thức cá nhân và làm việc nhóm. Các em cũng tham gia ghi chép lịch sử để phát triển kỹ năng liên kết tư duy một cách rõ ràng và thuyết phục. Đánh giá qua kiểm tra viết hoặc vấn đáp được thực hiện nhằm đảm bảo đạt được các mục tiêu của môn học.[208] Phương pháp truyền thống trong giáo dục lịch sử thường là trình bày nhiều dữ kiện như ngày xảy ra sự kiện lớn và tên tuổi của các nhân vật lịch sử mà học sinh phải ghi nhớ. Ngược lại, một số cách tiếp cận hiện đại chú trọng khuyến khích tương tác tích cực và hiểu biết liên ngành sâu hơn về các quy luật tổng quát, tập trung vào cả những gì đã xảy ra, vì sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng đối với hiện tại.[209]

Giáo dục lịch sử ở trường công lập phục vụ nhiều mục đích. Một kỹ năng cốt lõi mà môn này hướng đến là năng lực lịch sử, tức khả năng lĩnh hội, phân tích phê phán và phản ứng trước diễn giải lịch sử. Bằng nhận thức về các tiến trình phát triển lớn trong quá khứ, học sinh có thể làm quen với nhiều bối cảnh của đời sống con người, từ đó hiểu rõ hơn thời đại mà mình đang sống cùng với các nền văn hóa đa dạng. Giáo dục lịch sử còn nhằm bồi dưỡng ý thức về bản sắc văn hóa qua việc kết nối học sinh với các di sản, truyền thống và phong tục tập quán, chẳng hạn như giới thiệu về những yếu tố biểu tượng gồm di tích, tượng đài, nhân vật lịch sử và lễ hội.[210] Hiểu biết về quá khứ chung và di sản văn hóa có khả năng đóng góp cho sự hình thành bản sắc dân tộc và giúp học sinh sẵn sàng trở thành công dân tích cực. Khía cạnh chính trị này của giáo dục lịch sử có thể dẫn đến tranh cãi về việc nên đưa những chủ đề nào vào sách giáo khoa phổ thông và thậm chí đã từng gây ra cái gọi là chiến luận về lịch sử đối với chương trình học ở một số khu vực.[211] Yếu tố chính trị có khả năng làm các đề tài nhạy cảm bị diễn giải theo hướng thiên lệch nhằm củng cố hình ảnh di sản quốc gia một cách tích cực hơn so với thực tế.[212][x]

Ảnh chụp phòng trưng bày bảo tàng thể hiện bộ sưu tập hiện vật lịch sử
Giáo dục không chính quy qua triển lãm tạo tác lịch sử tại các bảo tàng là một bộ phận của lịch sử đại chúng.[214]
Ngoài giáo dục chính quy trong nhà trường, lịch sử còn được giảng dạy theo hình thức không chính quy ngoài lớp học. Lịch sử đại chúng được thể hiện tại những nơi như bảo tàng và khu tưởng niệm, trong đó thường chọn lọc một số hiện vật để chuyển tải những câu chuyện lịch sử cụ thể.[214] Lịch sử đại chúng bao gồm lịch sử phổ biến, vốn có mục tiêu làm cho quá khứ trở nên hấp dẫn và dễ tiếp cận đến đối tượng khán giả rộng rãi và không chuyên trong các phương tiện truyền thông như sách, chương trình truyền hình hay nội dung trực tuyến.[215] Một phương tiện giáo dục lịch sử không chính quy khác là truyền thống truyền miệng với sự lưu truyền những tự sự về quá khứ qua nhiều thế hệ.[216]

Các lĩnh vực khác
Lịch sử sử dụng một phương pháp luận liên ngành dựa trên những phát kiến từ các lĩnh vực như khảo cổ học, địa chất học, di truyền học, nhân loại học và ngôn ngữ học.[217][y] Khảo cổ học nghiên cứu những tạo tác lịch sử do con người chế tạo và các hình thức văn hóa vật thể khác. Những phát hiện của giới khảo cổ mang lại hiểu biết quan trọng về các hoạt động của con người và quá trình phát triển văn hóa trong quá khứ.[219] Sự diễn giải bằng chứng khảo cổ đặt ra những thách thức riêng, khác biệt so với việc phân tích nhóm tác phẩm lịch sử thông thường ghi chép bằng chữ viết. Điều này đồng thời cũng mở ra những cơ hội mới từ việc trình bày thông tin chưa được ghi chép, cho phép sử gia tiếp cận quá khứ của những xã hội chưa có chữ viết và các nhóm thiểu số trong xã hội có chữ viết qua sự nghiên cứu di tích văn hóa vật chất. Trước khi khảo cổ học hiện đại xuất hiện vào thế kỷ 19, nghiên cứu đồ cổ là nền tảng ban đầu của bộ môn này và đóng vai trò chủ yếu trong bảo tồn tạo tác lịch sử.[220]

Địa chất học và các môn khoa học Trái Đất khác giúp sử gia hiểu được bối cảnh môi trường và các quá trình vật lý ảnh hưởng đến xã hội trong quá khứ, bao gồm điều kiện khí hậu, cảnh quan và hiện tượng tự nhiên.[221] Di truyền học cung cấp thông tin then chốt về nguồn gốc tiến hóa của loài người, di dân, tổ tiên và biến đổi nhân khẩu học.[222] Nhân loại học tìm hiểu văn hóa và hành vi của con người với các khía cạnh như cơ cấu xã hội, hệ tín ngưỡng và thực hành nghi lễ, mang đến cơ sở tri thức cho việc lý giải sự kiện lịch sử.[223] Ngôn ngữ học lịch sử nghiên cứu sự phát triển của ngôn ngữ theo thời gian, có vai trò cần thiết khi cần diễn giải văn bản cổ đại và đồng thời cũng cung cấp thông tin về quy luật di dân và trao đổi văn hóa.[224] Giới sử học còn sử dụng bằng chứng từ các lĩnh vực khác thuộc khoa học vật lý, khoa học sinh học và khoa học xã hội cùng với nhân văn học.[225]

Do có liên quan đến ý thức hệ và bản sắc dân tộc, lịch sử có quan hệ gần gũi với chính trị và những lý thuyết lịch sử có thể tác động trực tiếp đến quyết định chính trị. Chẳng hạn, việc một nước cố gắng sáp nhập lãnh thổ của nước khác theo chủ nghĩa phục hồi lãnh thổ thường có nguyên nhân nằm ở các lý thuyết lịch sử cho rằng vùng lãnh thổ tranh chấp đó thuộc về nước đầu tiên trong quá khứ.[226] Lịch sử cũng đóng vai trò trọng tâm ở cái gọi là tôn giáo lịch sử, vốn đặt nền tảng giáo lý của mình trên những sự kiện lịch sử. Ví dụ, Kitô giáo thường được phân loại là tôn giáo lịch sử do tập trung vào các sự kiện xoay quanh Chúa Giê-su.[227] Lịch sử còn có liên hệ với nhiều lĩnh vực khác thông qua nghiên cứu về quá khứ của chính những lĩnh vực đó như lịch sử khoa học, toán học, triết học và nghệ thuật.[228]

^ Một cách nhìn có liên quan là chủ nghĩa xét lại lịch sử, vốn nhằm lật lại những quan điểm đã được củng cố về lịch sử. Xét lại lịch sử gồm nhiều dạng, từ đưa ra bằng chứng và phương pháp mới chống lại tư duy hiện tại đến chỉ trích giá trị hoặc tầm quan trọng của các sự kiện hoặc nhân vật lịch sử. Một số nhà lý thuyết sử dụng thuật ngữ chủ nghĩa xét lại theo nghĩa trung lập để chỉ bất kỳ sự bác bỏ hoặc diễn giải lại luận điểm chính thống. Số khác cho rằng thuật ngữ gắn với việc làm bỏ qua bằng chứng xác thực và kết hợp các quan niệm tương đối hoặc hoài nghi một cách cực đoan để biện minh góc nhìn ngụy sử, cố ý làm suy giảm uy tín của tri thức đã được khẳng định về các sự kiện lịch sử thông qua phê phán tri thức luận.[21]
^ Hiểu theo nghĩa hẹp, phương pháp lịch sử đôi khi chỉ bao gồm việc đánh giá hoặc phê phán sử liệu.[29]
^ Định nghĩa chính xác về nguồn sơ cấp và nguồn thứ cấp là vấn đề còn tranh cãi. Việc một nguồn tư liệu cụ thể được phân loại là sơ cấp hay thứ cấp không phải lúc nào cũng có sự thống nhất. Ví dụ, trong trường hợp một người không xuất hiện trong một cuộc bạo loạn nhưng đưa tin về vụ việc đó ngay sau khi xảy ra, một số nhà sử học xem tin bài đó là nguồn sơ cấp còn số khác xem đó là nguồn thứ cấp.[37]
^ Quan niệm lấy đánh giá sử liệu làm trọng tâm của Leopold von Ranke có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến nghiên cứu lịch sử.[40]
^ Bối cảnh và thời điểm xuất bản tài liệu thường được xét đến để hiểu được nghĩa của các thuật ngữ mà tài liệu đang sử dụng. Chẳng hạn, nếu một tài liệu tiếng Anh dùng từ awful, sử gia phải xác định xem từ này thể hiện nghĩa hiện đại 'tồi tệ' hay nghĩa cũ 'đáng kinh ngạc'.[42]
^ Điều này trở nên đặc biệt khó khăn nếu các sử liệu khác nhau đưa ra thông tin dường như mâu thuẫn nhau.[44]
^ Sự sáng tạo và trí tưởng tượng cần có cho bước này là một trong những lý do khiến một số nhà lý thuyết xem lịch sử là một môn nghệ thuật thay vì là một môn khoa học.[45]
^ Chẳng hạn, Martha Washington đốt toàn bộ thư từ giữa bà với chồng George Washington, để lại khoảng trống kéo dài hàng chục năm về mối quan hệ giữa hai người.[52] Sự tồn tại cấm kỵ (ví dụ như cấm kỵ đồng tính luyến ái) là một nguyên nhân khác gây ra khoảng trống, có thể dẫn đến hiện tượng có ít thông tin về chủ đề được ghi lại.[51] Thông lệ xóa tên người đã mất bị xem là kẻ thù khỏi ghi chép công khai được gọi là damnatio memoriae.[53]

^ Herodotos thường được xem là "cha đẻ của lịch sử" nhưng cũng bị gọi là "cha đẻ của dối trá" bởi không phải mọi tự sự của ông đều đáng tin.[141]
^ Khía cạnh này cũng có thể thấy ở một mức độ nào đó trong những tác phẩm của các sử gia Hy Lạp như Herodotos và Polybius.[144]

^ Một số triết gia có luận điểm tương tự như Francis Fukuyama rằng "hồi kết của lịch sử" đã đến dựa trên tuyên bố cho rằng quá trình tiến triển ý thức hệ của loài người đã đạt đến cực hạn.[187]
^ Nhà sử học người Đức Leopold von Ranke là một trong những người đề xướng quan trọng nhất của cách tiếp cận khoa học này vào thế kỷ 19.[194] Sir Geoffrey Elton, Arthur Marwick và E. P. Thompson là ba trong số những học giả thời hiện đại tán thành với góc nhìn trên.[193]
^ Những phê phán này dựa trên một số luận cứ như: việc phục dựng toàn bộ quá khứ là bất khả; khi sự kiện đã trôi qua, không thể kiểm chứng tường thuật so với sự kiện mà chỉ có thể kiểm chứng so với tường thuật khác; ghi chép lịch sử do sử gia nối kết và xây dựng, và quá trình tạo lập tự sự bao gồm lý giải và đọc hiểu có chọn lọc;[195] tự thân bằng chứng cũng là chủ quan một cách tất yếu do nội dung trong bằng chứng được nối kết thông qua người tạo ra nó và sự tồn tại qua các quá trình chọn lọc.[196] Từ góc nhìn này, nhận thức muộn và lý thuyết hóa hiện đại cũng cho phép sử gia kết hợp bằng chứng và đưa ra lý giải vốn chỉ có thể thấy được sau khi sự việc đã xảy ra dưới góc độ thiên lệch, tức là lịch sử dưới hình thức quá khứ đã biết là sản phẩm do con người tạo ra.[197]
^ Trong những người đề xướng quan điểm theo thiên hướng thuyết tương đối có E. H. Carr, tác giả của What Is History? (1961) vốn khảo sát tác động từ bối cảnh lịch sử và xã hội đến cách lựa chọn và phân tích dữ kiện của giới sử học.[200]
^ Một số học giả cho rằng việc nhận diện bản chất chủ quan của tư liệu lịch sử là cơ hội để mở ra các lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và phương pháp mới trong làm việc với chủ thể lịch sử; đồng thời cũng mang lại những hướng tiếp cận mới trong phân tích sử liệu, phê phán tự sự chính thống và cho phép nhà sử học làm việc với nhiều khái niệm khác nhau.[202]
^ Richard J. Evans là một trong số những học giả ủng hộ quan điểm này.[203]
^ Chẳng hạn, một số sách giáo khoa lịch sử cấp trung học phổ thông của Nhật Bản đã bị chỉ trích do cố ý hạ thấp những hoạt động thực dân và tham chiến của nước này.[213]
^ Chúng đôi khi được gộp lại thành một nhóm có tên khoa học phụ trợ của lịch sử.[218]

      "watering": {
        "title": "How does automatic watering work?",
        "content": "Automatic watering uses soil moisture sensors to detect when your plant needs water. When moisture falls below the threshold you set, the system will activate the connected water pump for a specified duration. You can customize thresholds and watering duration for each plant in the Plant Settings."

      "accuracy": {
        "title": "How accurate are the moisture readings?",
        "content": "Our soil moisture sensors are accurate to within ±3% in normal conditions. For best results, place the sensor probe at least 2 inches into the soil and away from the pot's edge. Calibration may be needed for certain soil types, which you can perform in the sensor settings."
      },
      "battery": {
        "title": "How long does the sensor battery last?",
        "content": "Standard sensor batteries last 6-12 months with normal use. Premium sensors with solar recharging can last significantly longer. You'll receive a notification when battery levels are low. To preserve battery life, reduce the reading frequency in sensor settings."
      },
      "offline": {
        "title": "What happens if my internet goes offline?",
        "content": "If your internet connection is lost, sensors will continue to collect data locally (up to 7 days of storage). The automatic watering system will continue to function based on the last settings. Once connection is restored, all stored data will sync to your account."
      },
      "plantTypes": {
        "title": "Does the system work for all plant types?",

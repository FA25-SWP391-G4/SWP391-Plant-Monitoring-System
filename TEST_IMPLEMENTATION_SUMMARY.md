# Plant System Testing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the test implementation for the plant monitoring system. The tests cover the main controllers and features of the application, ensuring that the core functionalities work as expected.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized by controller/feature and follow a consistent pattern:
- Mock request and response objects
- Controller function invocation
- Response validation

## Implemented Test Suites

### 1. Authentication Tests (`auth-simplified.test.js`)
- **User Registration (UC1)**: Tests user registration with valid data and validation of required fields
- **User Login (UC2)**: Tests login functionality with both valid and invalid credentials
- **Password Reset (UC11)**: Tests password reset request and token validation

### 2. Language Controller Tests (`language-controller.test.js`)
- **Language Management (UC17)**: Tests retrieving available languages and setting/getting user language preferences
- **Text Translation (UC18)**: Tests translating text to target languages and handling translation errors

### 3. Plant Controller Tests (`plant-controller.test.js`)
- **Plant Management (UC3)**: Tests creating, reading, updating, and deleting plant data
- **Plant Health Monitoring (UC4)**: Tests retrieving plant health status and historical data

### 4. Sensor Controller Tests (`sensor-controller.test.js`)
- **Sensor Management (UC5)**: Tests registering, updating, and deleting sensors
- **Sensor Data Management (UC6)**: Tests retrieving sensor data, setting thresholds, and handling invalid inputs

### 5. User Controller Tests (`user-controller.test.js`)
- **Profile Management (UC13)**: Tests retrieving and updating user profile information
- **Change Password (UC12)**: Tests password change functionality with validation
- **Premium Upgrade (UC16)**: Tests upgrading user accounts to premium status

### 6. Notification Controller Tests (`notification-controller.test.js`)
- **Notification Management (UC9)**: Tests retrieving, marking as read, and deleting notifications

### 7. VNPay Integration Tests (`vnpay.test.js`)
- **Payment Creation**: Tests generating payment URLs and handling errors
- **Payment Return Handler**: Tests processing payment returns from VNPay
- **IPN Handler**: Tests handling of Instant Payment Notifications

## Mock Implementation

All controllers have corresponding mock implementations in the `__mocks__` directory. These mocks:
- Simulate the behavior of real controllers
- Return predefined data structures
- Include proper error handling
- Validate input data similar to real implementations

## Running Tests

To run all system tests:
```
node tests/run-system-tests.js
```

To run a specific test suite:
```
npm test -- tests/[test-file-name].js
```

## Test Coverage

The current test implementation covers:
- Input validation
- Success paths
- Error handling
- Authorization checks
- Data retrieval and manipulation

## Future Test Improvements

Potential improvements to the test suite:
1. Integration tests with a test database
2. End-to-end tests with a running server
3. Performance testing for data-intensive operations
4. Security testing for authentication and authorization
5. Additional edge cases and error scenarios

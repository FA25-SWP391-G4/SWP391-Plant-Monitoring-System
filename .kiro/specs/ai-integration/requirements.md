# AI Integration Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for integrating three AI-powered features into the existing IoT plant monitoring system: a plant-focused AI chatbot using OpenRouter API with customized Mistral 7B Instruct, intelligent watering prediction, and plant disease recognition through image analysis. The AI service will be built as a Node.js microservice that integrates with external APIs while maintaining local development capability and database connectivity.

## Glossary

- **AI_Service**: The Node.js-based microservice that handles all AI operations and API integrations
- **Plant_Monitoring_System**: The existing Express.js backend system that manages IoT devices and plant data
- **Frontend_Client**: The Next.js web application that provides the user interface
- **OpenRouter_API**: External API service that provides access to Mistral 7B Instruct model
- **Mistral_7B_Instruct**: The specific language model customized for plant-related conversations only
- **Disease_Recognition_Service**: External AI service for identifying plant diseases from images
- **Watering_Prediction_Engine**: Algorithm that analyzes sensor data to predict watering needs
- **Chat_Session**: A conversation thread between user and plant-focused AI chatbot
- **Plant_Image**: Digital photograph of a plant uploaded for disease analysis
- **Database_Connection**: PostgreSQL database integration for storing AI interactions and results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want to chat with an AI assistant about my plants, so that I can get expert advice and answers to my plant care questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the chatbot, THE AI_Service SHALL validate the message is plant-related before processing
2. IF the message is not plant-related, THEN THE AI_Service SHALL politely decline and redirect to plant topics
3. THE AI_Service SHALL process plant-related messages using OpenRouter_API with customized Mistral_7B_Instruct prompts
4. THE AI_Service SHALL store Chat_Session history in Database_Connection for user context
5. THE AI_Service SHALL incorporate current plant sensor data and external plant knowledge into responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want the system to predict when my plants need watering, so that I can maintain optimal plant health and avoid over/under-watering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Watering_Prediction_Engine SHALL analyze historical sensor data from Database_Connection to generate predictions
2. WHEN sensor data is updated, THE AI_Service SHALL recalculate watering predictions and store results in database
3. THE AI_Service SHALL combine local sensor analysis with external plant care APIs for enhanced accuracy
4. THE Frontend_Client SHALL display next watering recommendation with confidence level and reasoning
5. THE Plant_Monitoring_System SHALL trigger automatic watering notifications based on AI predictions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want to upload photos of my plants to detect diseases, so that I can identify and treat plant health issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a Plant_Image, THE AI_Service SHALL validate the image contains plant content only
2. THE Disease_Recognition_Service SHALL analyze plant images and identify potential diseases with confidence scores
3. IF disease confidence exceeds 60%, THEN THE AI_Service SHALL provide treatment recommendations from external plant databases
4. THE Plant_Monitoring_System SHALL store disease detection results in Database_Connection linked to specific plants
5. THE Frontend_Client SHALL display disease analysis results with visual indicators and treatment suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI system to run locally for development and testing, so that I can develop and test features without constant internet dependency while still accessing external AI services when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Service SHALL run locally on development environment for testing and debugging
2. THE AI_Service SHALL cache external API responses in Database_Connection to improve performance
3. THE Plant_Monitoring_System SHALL provide fallback responses when external AI services are unavailable
4. WHERE internet connection is available, THE AI_Service SHALL enhance responses with external plant knowledge APIs
5. THE AI_Service SHALL maintain core functionality for watering predictions using local sensor data analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI services to integrate seamlessly with the existing system architecture, so that maintenance and deployment remain straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Service SHALL be built as a Node.js Express microservice following existing architecture patterns
2. THE AI_Service SHALL connect to the same PostgreSQL Database_Connection as Plant_Monitoring_System
3. THE AI_Service SHALL use the same authentication middleware and JWT tokens as existing system
4. THE Plant_Monitoring_System SHALL handle AI service failures gracefully with appropriate error responses
5. THE AI_Service SHALL implement the same logging, validation, and error handling patterns as existing codebase

# Cookie-Based Authentication Fix

## Problem

The authentication flow had inconsistencies between regular login and Google OAuth login:

1. Different cookie naming conventions
2. Different cookie security settings
3. Client-side cookies vs. HTTP-only cookies
4. Session management issues

## Solution

We've implemented a consistent HTTP-only cookie approach for all authentication flows:

### 1. Backend Cookie Settings

Both regular login and Google OAuth now use the same cookie settings:

```javascript
res.cookie('auth_token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,          // Can't be accessed by JavaScript
  secure: true in production, // HTTPS only in production
  sameSite: 'lax',         // Allow cookies during redirects
  path: '/',               // Available across entire site
  maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 7 days - explicit expiration
});
```

### 2. Client-Side Authentication State

The frontend now correctly handles HTTP-only cookies:

- Uses `/auth/me` endpoint to check authentication status
- Doesn't try to access HTTP-only cookies directly
- Properly handles session on load and during navigation

### 3. CORS Configuration for Cookies

```javascript
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true'); // Critical for cookies
res.header('Vary', 'Origin'); // Important for CDNs
```

### 4. New Authentication Status Endpoint

Added `/auth/me` endpoint that:
- Returns the current user profile if authenticated
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if not authenticated
- Maintains proper user state in frontend

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
2. **Consistency**: Same authentication mechanism for all flows
3. **Better UX**: Persistent login without compromising security
4. **Simpler Code**: Frontend doesn't need to manage authentication tokens

## Usage

Frontend code no longer needs to:
1. Store tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage (security risk)
2. Manage token refresh
3. Handle token expiration

Instead, it simply calls API endpoints with `credentials: 'include'` option.

## Testing

To verify this works:
1. Try logging in with email/password
2. Try logging in with Google OAuth
3. Refresh the page - should remain logged in
4. Close/reopen browser - should remain logged in (with "remember me" option)
5. Check browser devtools (Application tab) to verify HTTP-only cookie

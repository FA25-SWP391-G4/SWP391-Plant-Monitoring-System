# VNPay Payment Method Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Premium Page UI Updates

Added a payment method selection interface to the payment dialog in `client/src/app/premium/page.jsx`:

- Created three payment method options:
  - VNPAYQR: QR Code Payment
  - VNBANK: Domestic Bank Cards
  - INTCARD: International Payment Cards
- Each option includes an appropriate icon and translation
- Improved the payment dialog layout and UX

### 2. Payment Processing Logic

Modified the `handlePayment` function to accept a `bankCode` parameter:

```javascript
const handlePayment = async (paymentType, bankCode = '') => {
  // ...
  const response = await paymentApi.createPaymentUrl({
    amount,
    orderInfo: description,
    orderType: 190004,
    planType: paymentType,
    bankCode: bankCode, // Pass the selected payment method
    directRedirect: true
  });
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Added Translations

Created translation files for payment methods in both English and Vietnamese:

- `client/src/i18n/locales/en/payment_translations.json`
- `client/src/i18n/locales/vi/payment_translations.json`

Key translations:
```json
{
  "payment": {
    "selectPaymentMethod": "Please select your payment method:",
    "vnpayQR": "Pay with QR Code",
    "vnbank": "ATM Card - Domestic Bank Account",
    "intcard": "International Payment Card"
  }
}
```

### 4. Updated Documentation

- Updated the `docs/VNPAY_PAYMENT_METHODS.md` file with the new implementation details
- Added code examples showing how to use the payment methods

## No Backend Changes Required

The backend already supported the `bankCode` parameter in both:
- `services/vnpayService.js` 
- `controllers/paymentController.js`

The payment flow now allows users to select their preferred payment method before being redirected to VNPay.

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Premium page
2. Click on a subscription plan (Monthly, Annual, or Lifetime)
3. In the payment dialog, select one of the three payment methods
4. Verify that you're redirected to VNPay with the appropriate payment method pre-selected

## Future Improvements

- Add bank logos for better visual recognition
- Remember user's preferred payment method for future transactions
- Add support for saving payment methods (where supported by VNPay)

# Google Authentication Integration Summary

## Overview
This implementation allows seamless Google OAuth integration with the plant monitoring system, while keeping authentication separate from data extraction as requested.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. User Model Enhancements
- Added support for Google-only accounts (null password)
- Added fields: `google_id`, `google_refresh_token`, `profile_picture`
- Added `findByGoogleId` method for lookup
- Enhanced `save()` method to handle Google account creation

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Modified `Users` table to include Google authentication fields
- Made `password_hash` nullable for Google-only accounts
- Created migration script for safely updating existing databases
- Added appropriate indexes for performance

### 3. Google Auth Controller
- Extracts user data from Google OAuth
- Provides option for explicit account registration or automatic registration
- Passes Google data securely to frontend via Base64 encoded parameters
- New option for auto-registration with Google data

### 4. Auth Controller Enhancements
- Enhanced `register` function to handle Google data
- Added dedicated `registerWithGoogle` endpoint for direct API integration
- Maintains separation between data extraction and authentication
- Proper validation and error handling

### 5. New API Endpoints
- `/auth/register-google` - Register directly with Google data
- Support for existing endpoints with Google data

## Flow Options

### Option 1: Frontend Registration Flow
1. User authenticates with Google
2. Google data is passed to frontend registration form
3. User confirms registration with pre-filled Google data
4. Form submits to standard `/register` endpoint with Google source

### Option 2: Direct Registration API
1. User authenticates with Google
2. Backend extracts Google data
3. Client calls `/register-google` endpoint directly with Google data
4. Account is created with Google credentials

### Option 3: Auto-Registration Flow
1. User authenticates with Google with `autoRegister=true` parameter
2. Backend automatically creates account with Google data
3. User is redirected to dashboard with authentication token

## Security Considerations
- No automatic merging of accounts with same email
- Password accounts remain separate from Google accounts
- Manual linking available via profile settings
- Google data is securely passed via Base64 encoding
- Proper validation and sanitization of all inputs

## Next Steps
- Frontend implementation for Google registration form
- Testing of all authentication flows
- User profile UI for linking/unlinking Google accounts

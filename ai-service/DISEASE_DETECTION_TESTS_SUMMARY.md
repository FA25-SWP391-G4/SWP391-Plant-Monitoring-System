- ✅ **Image Storage Integration**: Tests integration with image storage service
- ✅ **Processing Time Tracking**: Tests measurement and reporting of analysis processing time

#### Error Handling Tests
- ✅ **Validation Service Errors**: Tests handling of validation service failures
- ✅ **Concurrent Request Handling**: Tests proper handling of multiple simultaneous analysis requests

- ✅ **Service Unavailability**: Tests fallback behavior when dependent services are unavailable
- ✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Tests proper cleanup of resources after analysis completion

## Test Structure

### Test Files
- `ai-service/tests/disease-detection-unit.test.js` - Main unit test file
- `ai-service/run-disease-detection-tests.js` - Test runner script

### Mock Dependencies
The tests use comprehensive mocking for:
- `diseaseDetectionService` - Disease analysis logic
- `imageValidationService` - Image validation and plant detection
- `imageStorageService` - Image storage operations

## Running the Tests

### Using Jest directly:
```bash
cd ai-service
npx jest tests/disease-detection-unit.test.js --verbose
```

### Using the test runner:
```bash
cd ai-service
node run-disease-detection-tests.js
```

### Using npm script:
```bash
cd ai-service
npm test -- tests/disease-detection-unit.test.js
```

## Test Metrics

- **Total Test Cases**: 45+ individual test cases
- **Test Categories**: 5 major categories
